Moses' companions said: Verily, Joseph (ﷺ) informed us that we would be saved from Pharaoh, and he made a covenant with us that we would depart with his bones. So Moses went out that night searching for his grave, and found an old woman whose house was upon Joseph's grave. He asked her about it, and she informed him according to her will, and her will was that she said: Take me and bring me out with you. So Moses took Joseph's bones in his garment, then carried the old woman upon his garment, and carried him upon his neck, and departed with him. And Pharaoh's horses came galloping swiftly before his eyes, and did not cease being blocked from Moses and his companions until they vanished from sight.",
