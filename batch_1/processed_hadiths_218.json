He said: No. So may I pray in the places where sheep rest? He said: Yes. Zayd ibn Ali said: There is no harm in praying on a mat and on bare ground. And Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The least a man may wear to pray is his garment, and the least a woman may wear to pray is a shirt and a headscarf. And Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: A female slave may pray without a headscarf.",

Abdullah ibn Rawahah said: O Messenger of Allah, I was unconscious for three days. What should I do about the prayers? The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Pray the prayer of the day you awakened, for it is sufficient for you. Zayd said: Regarding the unconscious person, if he was unconscious for less than three days, he repeats all of them. If he was unconscious for three days or more, he repeats only the prayers with limited time windows. If he awakens before Maghrib, he repeats Zuhr and Asr. If he awakens before Fajr, he repeats Maghrib and Isha. And this is the explanation of the Prophet's ﷺ saying to Abdullah ibn Rawahah: Repeat the prayers of your day.",

[Second chain:] From his father, from his grandfather, from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him: He used to pray after Friday two rak'ahs, then four, then return and rest. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The call (Adhan) on Friday is when the Imam ascends the minbar, and when he descends the Muezzin gives the Iqamah. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Imam speaks loudly in recitation on Friday and does not perform Qunut. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Friday prayer is only obligatory on the people of cities. Whoever is outside the city, Friday is not obligatory on him unless he hears the call, in which case it becomes obligatory. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Friday prayer is not obligatory on a slave, nor on a sick person, nor on a woman, nor on a traveler.",
