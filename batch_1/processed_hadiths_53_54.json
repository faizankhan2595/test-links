Ali then addressed the people and said: O people, beware of this deviation. The people asked: O Commander of the Faithful, and what is this deviation? He said: Those who liken Allah to themselves. They asked: How do they liken Allah to themselves? He said: They imitate the statement of those disbelievers from the People of the Scripture when they said: Allah created Adam in His image. Exalted and High is Allah above what they say, Exalted and High is Allah above what they associate with Him. Rather, Allah is the One, Singular, unlike whom is nothing, who has monopolized uniqueness and might, and executed will, desire, power, and knowledge about what is to be. There is no rival to Him in anything, no equal to Him that would match Him, no opposite to Him that would dispute with Him, no namesake to Him that would resemble Him, no like to Him that would be similar to Him, and matters do not appear suddenly to Him, states do not befall Him, and events do not descend upon Him. Rather, He causes states to flow and events to descend upon the created. The describers do not attain the reality of His truth, nor does it occur to hearts the extent of His might, for He has no like in creation and no equal in things. The knowledgeable do not comprehend Him with their minds, nor do the thinkers understand Him with their reflection and thought except through confirming belief in the unseen, for He is not described with any quality of the created, and He is the One with whom there is no equal, and what they call upon besides Him is falsehood, and indeed Allah is the Most High, the Most Great.",
