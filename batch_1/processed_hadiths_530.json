A man called Dhu al-Yadayn said to him: 'Has the prayer been shortened, O Messenger of Allah, or have you forgotten?' The Prophet ﷺ asked: 'Is Dhu al-Yadayn speaking the truth?' The people said: 'Yes.' The Prophet ﷺ stood and prayed two more rak'ahs, then he saluted. Then he said the Takbir and performed sujud like his usual sujud or even longer, then he raised and said the Takbir and performed another sujud like his usual sujud or even longer, then he raised.",

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him: 'The prayer has not been shortened, and I have not forgotten.' Dhu al-Shimaalayn said: 'Some of it did occur, O Messenger of Allah.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ turned to the people and asked: 'Is Dhu al-Yadayn truthful?' They said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ then completed the remaining of the prayer and then concluded with salutation. It is also reported from Ibn Shihab from Said ibn al-Musayyab and Abu Salamah ibn Abd al-Rahman with the same meaning. Malik said: Every omission that is a deficit in the prayer should have its prostration before the salutation, and every omission that is an addition to the prayer should have its prostration after the salutation.",

He looked at it and was pleased with what he saw of the fruit, then returned to his prayer and realized he did not know how much he had prayed. He said: 'This property of mine has caused me trial.' He came to Uthman ibn Affan while he was Caliph and mentioned this, saying: 'This is charity, so put it in charitable causes.' Uthman ibn Affan sold it for fifty thousand dinars, and that became known as the 'fifty thousand property.'",
