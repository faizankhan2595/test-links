      "english_translation": "Narrated by Ali: Umar led the people in the Fajr prayer while he was in a state of ritual impurity. When he finished the prayer, he turned to the people and said: 'O people, indeed Umar led you in prayer while he was ritually impure.' The people said: 'What do you command, O Commander of the Believers?' He said: 'I must repeat, but there is no need for you to repeat.' Then Ali said: 'Nay, rather you and they must repeat. Do you not see that the people follow their Imam? They enter when he enters, they exit when he exits, they bow when he bows, they prostrate when he prostrates. If an error occurs to him, it occurs to those behind him.' So some people followed Ali's view and some followed Umar's view.",
