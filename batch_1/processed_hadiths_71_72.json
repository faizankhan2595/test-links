This occurred on the last day of Jumada al-Thani and the first day of Rajab. There was a covenant between the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and Quraysh, so Quraysh said: Did you kill in the sacred month while we have a covenant? Allah revealed: 'They ask you about fighting in the sacred month. Say: Fighting in it is great' - meaning all of this is greater than the killing of Ibn al-Hadramī. Then He said: 'And the persecution' - meaning disbelief in Allah and the worship of idols is greater than all of this.",
