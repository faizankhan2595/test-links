Abu al-Yasr came with two prisoners and said: 'O Messenger of Allah! You said whoever brings a prisoner gets such a reward and whoever brings a head gets such a reward, and I have brought these two.' Said ibn Ubadah said: 'O Messenger of Allah! We saw where they took (the prisoners) and we guarded you for fear of your safety.' Abu al-Yasr started speaking, and when he finished, Said ibn Ubadah spoke. Then the verse was revealed: 'They ask you about the spoils of war. Say: The spoils belong to Allah and the Messenger' (Surah al-Anfal 1).",
