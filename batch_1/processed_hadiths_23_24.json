Al-Rabi' said: The finest ones are the best choices, and the full-uddered is one with a large udder. Additionally, Abu Ubaydah said: The Prophet ﷺ forbade a man from deliberately selecting the worst of his wealth to give as Zakat. He said: 'The best of you in the sight of Allah is he who brings forth the best of his wealth.'",

I hope for its reward and its treasure with Allah. So place it, O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, wherever you wish. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him: 'Well done, well done! That is wealth that brings its owner to Paradise. I have heard what you said, and I think you should give it to your relatives.' Abu Talha said: I will do so, O Messenger of Allah.

Do you have anything? She said: Yes. She brought out barley loaves, then took her veil and wrapped the bread partially in it, hid it under my arms, and covered me partially with it, then sent me to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Anas said: So I went and found the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sitting in the mosque with people. I stood, and he said: Did Abu Talha send you? I said: Yes. He said: With food? I said: Yes. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to those with him: Get up. Anas said: So we set out until we came to Abu Talha and I informed him. Abu Talha said: O Um Sulaim, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ has come with the people, and we do not have food to feed them. Anas said: So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ entered and said: O Um Sulaim, what do you have? So I brought that bread. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered it to be broken up, and Um Sulaim poured her ghee over it, which made a sauce for it. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said something over the food, then said: Let in ten. They entered, ate until they were full, then left. Then he said: Let in ten. They entered, ate until they were full, likewise, until all the people ate, and they were seventy men.",
