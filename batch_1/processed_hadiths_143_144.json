One day he became thirsty seeking water and asked the jinn and mankind where it was but they did not know. He inspected the birds and did not find the hoopoe and threatened it, saying 'I will surely punish him with a severe punishment, meaning by plucking out all his feathers and sunning him, or I will slaughter him or he will bring me clear authority.' The hoopoe then came, and the birds met him and said: Solomon has threatened you. The hoopoe asked them: Did he make an exception? They said: Yes, he said 'unless he brings me clear authority.' So the hoopoe came with the excuse that was in the Qur'an. When Bilqis, the queen of Sheba approached, she was a distance from Solomon. Solomon mentioned the throne and said: Who among you will bring me her throne before they come to me as Muslims? It was brought to him. Solomon commanded that it be changed. When she came, it was said to her: Is your throne like this? She said: It is as if it is the same. When she entered the pavement floor, she thought it was a pool of water and uncovered her shins, and behold she was a woman with hairy legs. Solomon said: What removes this hair? It was said to him: Al-Noura (lime/hair removal), and from that day forward, al-Noura was used.",
