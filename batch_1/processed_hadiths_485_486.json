I went to him to collect my wages, but he said: I will never give you anything until you disbelieve in Muhammad ﷺ. I said: I will not disbelieve in Muhammad ﷺ until Allah causes you to die and then resurrects you. He said: When I die, I will be resurrected and I will have wealth and children. So this verse was revealed: (Quran 19:77-78): 'Have you seen the one who disbelieved in Our verses and said: I will surely be given wealth and children. Has he glimpsed the unseen, or has he taken a covenant with the Most Merciful?' to the end of the verse.",

He said: The elite of the people. The companions of Abdullah used to read it: 'The stratagem of magic.' Regarding His statement (20:80-81): 'Children of Israel, We have saved you from your enemy and made a covenant with you on the right side of the Mount, and We sent down to you manna and quail, eat from the good of what We have provided for you.' Regarding His statement (20:82): 'For those who repent, believe, and do righteous deeds, then are guided.' He said: Repented of sins, believed in monotheism, did righteous deeds then fasted and prayed, and knew that it has a reward. Regarding His statement (20:100): 'Whoever turns away from it will bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection.' He said: The burden is polytheism. Regarding His statement (20:106-107): 'So We will leave it as a plain level ground, you cannot see in it any curve nor flatness.' He said: The earth will appear completely level. The curve is the crack and the flatness is the elevated place. Regarding His statement (20:108): 'The caller with no deviation from it.' He said: No deviation from it. Regarding His statement (20:108): 'You will not hear except a whisper.' He said: The footsteps of feet. Regarding His statement (20:111): 'Faces will be humbled.' He said: They will be abased and degraded. Regarding His statement (20:111): 'Whoever has borne injustice has failed.' He said: Injustice is polytheism. Regarding His statement (20:112): 'Will not fear injustice or diminishment.' He said: Injustice is when his right is wronged, and diminishment is when some of his right is diminished. Regarding His statement (Surah Al-Jinn 72:13): 'Will not fear diminishment or burden.' He said: All of his right is diminished, and burden means some of his right is diminished. Regarding His statement (20:115): 'He forgot and We did not find in him determination.' He said: Preservation (memory).",
