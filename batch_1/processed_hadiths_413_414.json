Then behold, he encountered a lion. He said to it: \"O Abu al-Harith (O father of death), I am the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and my situation is thus and thus.\" So the lion approached him with its tongue hanging out until it stood beside him. Whenever it heard a sound, it came to him, then it went back to walking beside him until he reached the army, then the lion returned.",

A man left the unjust village intending to go to the righteous village, but death came to him as Allah willed. The angel and Satan disputed over him. Satan said: \"By Allah, he never disobeyed me.\" The angel said: \"He has left intending repentance.\" They judged between them that they should look at which of the two villages was closer, and they found him closer to the righteous village by a span (handwidth), so he was forgiven.\" Ma'mar said: \"And I heard someone say: 'Allah brought the righteous village closer to him.'\"",

I passed by him and greeted him but he did not return my greeting.\" He said: \"Let us go to him.\" So they both passed by him and greeted him, and he returned their greeting. Abu Bakr said to him: \"What is the matter with you? Your brother passed by you just now and greeted you but you did not return his greeting.\" He said: \"I did not do that.\" Umar said: \"Yes, you did! But this is arrogance with you, O Banu Umayyah!\" Abu Bakr said: \"Yes, you did it, but something distracted you from it.\" He said: \"I was remembering the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and remembering that Allah took him away before we asked him about the salvation of this matter (the Caliphate).\" Abu Bakr said: \"I asked him about that.\" Uthman said: \"May my father and mother be ransomed for you! You are more deserving of that.\" Abu Bakr said: \"I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, what is the salvation of this matter that we are in?' He said: 'Whoever accepts the word that I presented to my uncle and he rejected it, that word will be salvation for him.'\"",
