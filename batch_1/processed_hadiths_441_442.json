He sent a messenger upon whom were tattered clothes. They found him and were pushing him, saying to him: Get out! He said: Did you not prepare this food so that people would eat it? They said: Yes, but your like does not eat it. Only the righteous servants of the king eat from the king's food. He said: So he went out, then came back wearing fine clothes and passed by them, but did not enter. They hastened to him, or he said: They rushed toward him, calling him, and he refused to come with them. They said: If you do not come with us, the king will punish us if he is informed that you passed by here. He said: So he made his clothes drip in the food. That is their likeness.",

Saad said while they were in a gathering: Recite your genealogy O so-and-so! So he recited, then he said to another, then to another, until he reached Salman. He said: Recite your genealogy O Salman! He said: I do not know a father for myself in Islam, but I am Salman the son of Islam. This reached Umar. Umar said to Saad and when he met him: Recite your genealogy O Saad! He said: I take Allah as witness O Commander of the Believers! It was as if he knew. He refused to let him go until he recited, then he said to another until he reached Salman. He said: Recite your genealogy O Salman! He said: Allah has blessed me with Islam, so I am Salman the son of Islam. Umar said: Quraysh knows that al-Khattab was their mightiest in the pre-Islamic era, and I am Umar the son of Islam, brother of Salman in Islam. By Allah, if it were not so, I would have punished you with a punishment that the people of the cities would hear. Did you not know, or did you not hear that a man claimed ancestry to nine fathers in the pre-Islamic era, and he was the tenth of them in the Fire, and a man claimed ancestry to a man in Islam and left what was above that, and he was with him in Paradise.",

So he sat until the man came. When he saw the Prophet ﷺ, he put a rope around his waist, then climbed his palm tree and cut a cluster from it, and brought it to the Prophet ﷺ. Then he entered his sheep and took a sheep to slaughter. The Prophet ﷺ said: Avoid the nursing (ones). When he finished, the Prophet ﷺ said: When captives come to us, come to us. So captives came to the Prophet ﷺ and he distributed them among the people until only two slaves remained with him. The Ansari came and the Prophet ﷺ said: Choose whichever you wish. He said: Rather you choose for me, O Messenger of Allah! So the Prophet ﷺ stroked one of his hands over the other twice while saying: The one consulted is a trustee, the one consulted is a trustee. Take this one for the one, for I saw him praying.",

He said: Among those sitting with him was the nephew of Uyayna ibn Hisn. Uyayna came to Umar and said: By Allah, you do not speak justice, nor do you give generously. Umar was about to harm him, when the nephew of Uyayna said: O Commander of the Believers! Indeed Allah says (in Surah Al-A'raf, verse 199): Take what is given to you freely, and enjoin what is right, and turn away from the ignorant. This one is from the ignorant. So Umar left him. When Uthman became leader, Uyayna came to him and said: Indeed Umar gave us and enriched us and we feared him.",

Narrated also: Someone informed me from hearing Ikrimah narrating that Umar ibn al-Khattab struck a man for the same thing. Also from al-Zuhri, he said: I asked Ibn al-Musayyab and Abu Salamah ibn Abd al-Rahman about this and they disliked it and forbade me from it. Also from Qatadah, that Abdullah ibn Amr said: This is the lesser Lot's sin. Also from Qatadah, from Abu al-Darda, that he was asked about this, and he said: Would anyone do this except a disbeliever? Also from Laith, from Mujahid, from Abu Hurayrah that he said: Whoever does this has disbelieved.",

They would say: By Allah, we do not intend to kill him. Aflah said: He left leaning on my hand, saying: By Allah, you will kill him. He also said to them when he was besieged: Leave this man forty nights. By Allah, if you leave him, he will die in that. They refused.
