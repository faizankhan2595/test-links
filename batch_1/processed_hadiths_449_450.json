So I brought him a caravan but he died, and that wasn't his affair. So he said: Do you have a brother older than you? He said: Yes. He said: Let him perform hajj on behalf of your father and you perform hajj with him. For indeed your father, if he had a debt upon him and it was paid off for him, it was accepted from him. So Allah is more merciful. He was asked about the boy who performs hajj with his family - does what remains upon the muhrim remain upon him?",
