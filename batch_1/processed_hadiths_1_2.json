Umar said: I moved my camel forward ahead of the people and feared that a revelation might come down regarding me. As I traveled, I heard a crier calling out, so I hurried until I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and greeted him. He said: A chapter has been revealed to me which is dearer to me than everything upon which the sun rises. Then he recited: Indeed, We have given you a clear victory.",

I said: O Messenger of Allah, I heard this man reciting Surah al-Furqan differently from how you taught me. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the man: Recite. He recited, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: That is how it was revealed. Umar said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to me: Recite. I recited, and he said: That is how it was revealed.
