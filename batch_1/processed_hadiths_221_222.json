She said: 'I use them to count my praises each day.' He said: 'Verily, I have said in my standing here something greater than all that you have glorified throughout all your days.' She asked: 'And what is it, O Messenger of Allah?' He said: 'I said: Glory be to You, O Allah, according to the number of what Your Book has enumerated, and Glory be to You, the weight of Your Throne, and the extremity of Your pleasure.'",

Then Zaid ibn Ali was asked about washing the deceased: He should be placed on his washing platform directed toward the Qiblah with his private parts covered. Then perform for him the ablution as for prayer. Then wash his head, beard and entire body with water mixed with lote leaves. Then wash his head, beard and entire body with water and camphor. Then wash his head, beard and entire body with plain water with nothing mixed in it. This constitutes three washings. Then dry him with a cloth. Then place perfume on his head and beard, follow the marks of his prostration with camphor. Then spread his shrouds which are three garments: a shirt, a wrapper, and a shroud. Then dress him in the shirt, wrap the wrapper around him, and envelop him in the shroud like a robe and place him on the wood. If you fear anything will come loose from the shrouds, tie it. Then his washing is complete. When asked about how many shrouds a man is wrapped in, Zaid answered: Three garments: a shirt, a wrapper, and a shroud. When asked how many shrouds a woman is wrapped in, he said: Five garments: a dress, a head covering, a wrapper, a band to tie the shrouds, and a shroud.",
