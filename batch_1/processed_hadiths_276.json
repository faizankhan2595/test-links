When He created him, He said: Go and greet those group of angels who are sitting, and listen to how they greet you, for it will be your greeting and the greeting of your offspring. He went and said: Peace be upon you. They said: Peace and the mercy of Allah be upon you. They added: and the mercy of Allah. So everyone who enters Paradise will enter with the form of Adam, his height being sixty cubits, and the creation has not ceased to diminish after that until now. The Angel of Death came to Moses and said to him: Respond to your Lord. Moses struck the eye of the Angel of Death and put it out. The angel returned to Allah and said: You sent me to Your servant who does not wish for death, and he has put out my eye. Allah restored his eye and said: Go back to My servant and say to him: Do you desire life? If you wish for life, place your hand on the back of an ox, and for every hair that your hand covers, you will live a year. He said: Then what? He said: Then you will die. He said: Now from near. He said: My Lord, bring me closer to the holy land by a stone's throw. The Prophet said: If I were there, I would show you his grave by the side of the road near the red sand hill.",
