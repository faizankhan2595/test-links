When he entered, I said: 'O my head aches!' He said: 'I wish it had been so, that I might witness upon you and pray over you.' I said: 'I think if that had happened, you would not have spent the evening of your day until you consummated your marriage with one of your wives.' Then he said: 'O my head aches' twice. Then he said: 'Call Abu Bakr and his son so I may make my testament to him so that no one aspires to leadership.' But Allah refused, and the believers rejected it. Ubaidullah [ibn Abdullah] said: I went out and sat with Ibn Abbas and said: 'If only you could have seen your mother Aisha saying such things.' Ibn Abbas replied: 'Who were the two men?' I said: 'As for one of them, it was al-Abbas, and as for the other, I did not name him.' Ibn Abbas said: 'The other was Ali ibn Abi Talib, but do not spread this report.'",
