Umar said: By Allah, I think that if I gathered these people under one reader, it would be better. So he gathered them under Ubayy ibn Ka'b. Then I went out with him another night and the people were praying behind their reader, and Umar said: What an excellent innovation this is! And that sleep which you abandon is better than that which you are doing, meaning the last part of the night, and the people used to pray in the first part of the night.",
