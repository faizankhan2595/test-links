Umar ordered her to be stoned, but Ali ibn Abi Talib met her and said: What is wrong with this woman? They said: Umar ordered her to be stoned. Ali said to Umar: Did you command that she be stoned? He said: Yes, she confessed to me for adultery. Ali said: This is your authority over her, what is your authority over what is in her belly? Amir al-Mu'minin said: I did not know she was pregnant. Ali said: If you did not know, then establish a waiting period for her. Then he said: Or did you perhaps frighten her or terrify her? He said: That may have happened. Ali said: Did you not hear the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying: There is no punishment upon one who confesses after coercion, for whoever you bind, imprison, or threaten, there is no confession from them? So Umar released her. Then he said: Women have failed to give birth to one like Ali ibn Abi Talib. If not for Ali, Umar would have perished.",
