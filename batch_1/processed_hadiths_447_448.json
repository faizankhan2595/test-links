And [separate chain]: From Zayd ibn Aslam, I do not know it except as mursal: He said: Allah has not created any creation except He created what overcomes it. His mercy overcomes His anger, and charity extinguishes sin like water extinguishes fire. And Allah created the earth and it flourished and became decorated, saying: What overcomes me? So He created mountains and made them firm. The mountains said: We overcame the earth, what overcomes us? So He created iron. Iron said: We overcame the mountains, what overcomes us? So He created water. Water said: We overcame fire, what overcomes us? So He created wind. He placed it in the clouds. Wind said: We overcame water, what overcomes us? So He created man building structures that wind cannot penetrate. Man said: We overcame wind, what overcomes us? So He created death. Death said: We overcame man, what overcomes us? Allah said: I overcome you.",

He recited to us the verse from Surah al-Nisa': 'and do not associate partners with Him' (verse 36). Then he said: Whoever fulfills it, his reward is upon Allah. Whoever commits a sin from that and is punished for it in this world, then it is a purification for him, or he said: an expiation. Whoever commits a sin from that and Allah conceals it for him, then his matter is with Allah. If He wills, He will forgive him, and if He wills, He will punish him.",

Nothing makes one better than another - black or green - until your companion is pleased with you. I set out seeking him and he saw me before I saw him. He said: Peace be upon you, O Abu Dharr. I came and greeted him and said: Forgive me. He said: May Allah forgive you. Then I came to the Prophet ﷺ and mentioned that to him and informed him that he was pleased with me and had sought forgiveness for me. I said: Forgive me, O Messenger of Allah. He said: May Allah forgive your companion. Then I said: Forgive me, O Messenger of Allah. He said: May Allah forgive your companion.

The lender said: I will not lend to you until you bring me a guarantor. The borrower said: I cannot find anyone to guarantee for me, but for you Allah is a guarantor and surety that I will repay you. So he lent to him. The lender then traveled by sea. When the time for repayment came, he was unable to travel to him, and the sea separated them. He took a piece of wood and drilled it, then placed the dinars in it, wrote a letter to him and placed it with the dinars. Then he sealed it. Then he said: O Allah, You took responsibility for me, and whoever pays the guarantor is absolved. Indeed, I am paying to you. He threw the wood into the sea, and the wind or the waves buffeted it back and forth. He said: If I had taken this wood for firewood for my family. So he took the wood. When he entered his house, he broke it and found the dinars and the letter, and it was from his companion. Time passed until his companion came and confronted him. He said: By Allah, indeed Allah knows that I have repaid you. He was silent towards him and went with him to count it. When he brought them out, he said: By Allah, indeed Allah knows that I have repaid you. He said: How did you repay? He informed him how he had done it. He said: Then Allah has repaid it for you.",

He nursed him until he died, taking nothing from his wealth. He was visited in a dream and told to go to a place and take one hundred dinars. He asked in his dream: Is there blessing in it? They said: No. He refused and told his wife, who encouraged him to take it. He refused. That evening, he dreamed again about taking ten dinars, but again was told no blessing. He refused. On the third night, he was told to take one dinar, and this time was told: Yes, there is blessing in it. He took the dinar to the market and found a man with two fish asking one dinar. He bought them. At home, when he split them, he found a pearl in each belly like none the people had seen. The king sought to buy one pearl but found it only with him. He sold it for thirty camels of gold. The king said: This needs a partner. They came to him offering double the price for the other pearl, and he gave it.",
