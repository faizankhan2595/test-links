They came to Ibn Salam and spoke to him in this manner. He said to one of them: 'You are so-and-so son of so-and-so,' and said to the other: 'You are so-and-so son of so-and-so. The Commander of the Believers sent you. Give him my greetings and inform him that he will be killed, so let him desist, for that will be stronger for his argument before Allah on the Day of Resurrection.' They came to him and informed him. Then Uthman said: 'I charge you that no one of you fights with me.' Marwan said: 'And I charge myself to fight,' so he fought and was struck upon his neck. He continued lying with his chin upon his chest until he died.",

Then she said: 'O Ubayd Allah ibn Adiyy, let not anyone deceive you after the group whom you know, for by Allah, the deeds of the companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ were not belittled until the readers who criticized Uthman were tested. They recited a recitation not like it, and prayed a prayer not like it, and fasted a fast not like it, and spoke a speech we cannot speak like it. When I considered the craftsmanship, I found they did not approach the companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. So when you hear the beautiful speech of a man, then say: \"Work, and Allah will see your deeds and His Messenger and the believers\" from Surah At-Tawbah, verse 105, and let not anyone deceive you.'",

Indeed, when they attacked Uthman and killed him, I said to the son of Abu Talib: Avoid this matter, for you will be dealt with, so spare yourself. But he disobeyed me, and I do not think he will succeed. By Allah, Mu'awiyyah ibn Abu Sufyan will surely prevail over you, because Allah said: \"Whoever is killed wrongfully, We have given authority to his heir\" from Surah Al-Isra, verse 33. By Allah, Quraysh will surely conduct themselves among you in the manner of Persia and Rome.' He said: We said: 'What do you command us, O Ibn Abbas, if we encounter that?' He said: 'Whoever among you takes what he knows is right will be saved, and whoever abandons it while you too abandon it, will be like one of these generations that perished.'",

      "english_translation": "Narrated from Ibn Taus from Ikramah ibn Khalid: Malik al-Ashtar entered upon Ali and said: The people have objected to some matters and said: 'How similar is tonight to yesterday! We objected to a matter and we find ourselves in the like of it.' He said: And with him were al-Hasan ibn Ali and Abdullah ibn Abbas. Then Ali said: 'O boy! Bring me the Jami'ah (collective statement of pact) and the sword.' Then al-Hasan and Ibn Abbas stood and said: 'O Commander of the Believers, we beseech you by Allah!' They continued speaking to him until he abandoned it and said to him: 'Go away.' He went out quickly and descended the steps of the house in fear. Then Ali said when he left: 'He separated us, so we separated him. So which of us was more destructive to his companion?'",

I said to a man from Banu Yashkur: 'Let us go to the Commander of the Believers until we ask him about his saying: Allah and His Messenger have spoken the truth.' He said: We went to him and said: 'O Commander of the Believers, we saw you whenever you witnessed a sight, or descended into a valley, or looked over a hill, you would say: Allah and His Messenger have spoken the truth. Did the Messenger of Allah ﷺ make a covenant with you regarding this?' He said and we pressed him, so when he saw that, he said: 'By Allah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not make any covenant with me except something he made with all people. However, the people attacked Uthman and killed him. In this matter, others were in worse condition and worse action than me. Then I saw that I was the most deserving of this matter, so I overtook it.

He said: 'And for something else. Do you see, when you are between the two mountain passes (al-Ma'zamayn) below Mina, from that place to the sunrise there is the place of As-Surar, or he said: the mosque of As-Surar. Seventy prophets were granted their prayers in it. One of the prophets sheltered under a Sarahah tree, made supplication and it was answered for him, and he made supplication for it and it was protected as you see it now. It does not decay as sorcery decays.' Ma'mar said: 'Surru' (they were granted): their tombs were cut off. La ya'tallu (does not decay): meaning it does not become hollow from beneath ever.'",
