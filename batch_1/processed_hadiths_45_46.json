When I came to her, she was found to have lost one of the sheep from the flock. I asked her about it, and she said: 'The wolf ate it.' I became angry and grieved at this until I struck her face, and upon me is a slave-freeing obligation. Should I free her?' The Prophet ﷺ said: 'If she comes, bring her to me.' The man brought her to the Prophet ﷺ, and the Prophet ﷺ asked her: 'Who is your Lord?' She said: 'Allah is my Lord.' He asked: 'Who is your Prophet?' She said: 'You are Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah.' The Prophet ﷺ said to the man: 'Free her, for she is a believer.'",

I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I have reached a point of pain such as you see. I am a man of property and I have only a single daughter as an heir. May I give charity with two-thirds of my wealth?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then with half?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Then with one-third?' He said: 'Yes, one-third is sufficient. For one-third is much. Indeed if you leave your heirs wealthy it is better than leaving them in need, begging from the people. And whatever expense you spend with the intention of seeking Allah's pleasure, you shall be rewarded for it, even if you spend on your wife.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, shall I remain behind after my companions?' He said: 'You shall not be left behind but will perform good deeds and gain higher ranks and honor. Perhaps you will remain so that some people will benefit from you and others will be harmed by you. O Allah, complete the migration of my companions, do not turn them back on their heels - but the poor Sa'd ibn Khawlah is pitiable [he died in Makkah].' The Prophet ﷺ expressed regret for him because he died in Makkah. Al-Rabi' explains: The meaning of 'some will benefit from you and others will be harmed' is that when Sa'd was appointed over Iraq, he fought those who apostatized and struck them. He called others who were copying the rhyming speech of Musaylimah the Liar to repent, and they repented and benefited from him. And his saying 'struck them' means he killed them by striking.",

Al-Rabi' explains: The guardian is the protector, and the one who harvests is he who removes the herbage from it. Abu Ubaidah from the path of Ibn Umar said: The Prophet ﷺ said: Let none of you milk the livestock of another without permission. Would any of you like if someone came to your storage, broke open your container, and took your food? The udders of their livestock are their storage containers for their food. It is not permissible to milk another's livestock without permission. Al-Rabi' from Ubadah ibn al-Samit said: The Prophet ﷺ said: Return the needle and thread, and beware of illicit taking, for it is disgrace upon its people on the Day of Judgment.",
