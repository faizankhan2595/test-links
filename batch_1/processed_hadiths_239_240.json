He said: He has no right to anything but ten sa'. I said: What if he found it to be nine? He said: He would have nine-tenths of the price. If he wishes he may take it, and if he wishes he may return it, because the seller did not fulfill his specification. And I asked Zaid ibn Ali about a man who purchased a flock of sheep specifying twenty sheep for ten dinars and found twenty-one. He said: The sale is void. I said: What if he found nineteen? He said: The sale is void. I said: What if the seller specified a price for each sheep?

    "english_translation": "Narrated by Abdullah ibn Ubayd al-Liythi from his father, from his grandfather, from Ali, may Allah be pleased with them: That he disliked the sale of fresh dates for dried dates, and said: 'Indeed it decreases when it dries.' And he said: 'I asked Zaid ibn Ali about exchanging one qafiz of wheat for one qafiz of flour. He said: It is not permissible.' And I asked Zaid ibn Ali about exchanging one qafiz of wheat for one qafiz of suq (ground grain soup). He said: It is not permissible.' And I asked Zaid ibn Ali about ten artal of ghee or more for one qafiz of sesame. He said: 'If in the qafiz there are ten artal of ghee or more, the sale is void. And if what is in it of ghee is less than ten artal, the sale is permissible.'",
