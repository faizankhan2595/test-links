    "english_translation": "Narrated by Mujahid: Regarding the Quranic verse 'What is the matter with you concerning the hypocrites divided into two groups' - he said: They are a people who came out from Makkah until they reached Madinah, claiming that they were emigrating. Then they apostasized after that and asked permission from the Prophet ﷺ to go to Makkah to bring their merchandise. The believers differed about them, some saying they are from us and others saying they are hypocrites. Allah made clear their status and commanded fighting them. They came with their merchandise wanting Hilal ibn Uwaymah al-Aslami who had a covenant with the Prophet ﷺ. Regarding His saying 'Their hearts are straitened' - their chests were straitened, meaning they were reluctant to fight the believers or their own people while defending them because they were heading toward Hilal, and there was a covenant between him and the Prophet ﷺ. Then He said 'You will find others who desire to be safe from you and safe from their own people' - these are people from the people of Makkah who came to the Prophet ﷺ and became Muslim out of show, then returned to their people and reverted to idols, desiring to be safe here and there. So the Prophet ﷺ commanded fighting them if they did not withdraw.",

Then Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, who was his brother from his mother, came to him along with another man. He said to him: Your mother appeals to you by the wombs that bore you and her rights that you return to her. She is Asma' bint Makhribah. So he went with them. They bound him until they brought him to Makkah. They tortured him. When the disbelievers saw this, it increased them in disbelief and temptation. They said: Abu Jahl is certainly able to overcome Muhammad ﷺ and take his companions. Then the man who was with Abu Jahl embraced Islam, and Ayyash killed him without knowing of his Islam. So Allah revealed: 'And it is not for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake.'",

They were oppressed in Makkah. The companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: They are in the station of those killed at Badr from the weak of Quraysh.

The polytheists said: This one has not accomplished anything. So Allah revealed: 'Whoever leaves his house emigrating to Allah and His Messenger, and death overtakes him, then his reward is upon Allah.' Second narration: Narrated by Mujahid: Regarding His saying 'There is no blame upon you to shorten the prayer' - and that was the day when the Prophet ﷺ was at Usfan and the enemy at Dajnan. So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ performed the Noon prayer with his companions of four rakats - their bowing, their prostration, their standing and sitting all together. The polytheists intended to raid their possessions when they stood for the Afternoon prayer. So Allah revealed 'When you are among them and you establish prayer for them, let a group stand with you' to the end of the verse. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ lined up his companions behind him in two rows. Then he takbir with them and they takbir all together. Then the first ones prostrated with the prostration of the Prophet ﷺ while the others stood guard. Then the others prostrated. Then he takbir with them and they takbir all together. The other row came forward and the first row moved back. They alternated in prostration as they did the first time. The Afternoon prayer was shortened to two rakats.",
