      "english_translation": "Narrated by Ibn Abbas: A man came out one day raising his gaze to the sky, lifting his hands above his head making supplication to his Lord. Ibn Abbas said to him: Supplicate your Lord with your right finger, and ask with your left palm. Lower your gaze and hold your hand, for you will not see Him and you will not attain Him. The man asked: Not even in the Hereafter? He replied: Not even in the Hereafter. The man asked: Then what is meant by the statement of Allah: Faces gleaming on that Day, gazing toward their Lord? Ibn Abbas responded: Do you not read the verse: No sight can grasp Him, but His sight grasps all? Then Ibn Abbas said: The allies of Allah will have their faces radiant on the Day of Judgment, which is the radiance and splendor. Then they will gaze toward their Lord waiting for His permission to enter Paradise after the completion of the reckoning. Then he mentioned the verse about gloomy faces, meaning dark and displeasing, fearing that punishment will be done to them. They await punishment after punishment. And similarly the verse gazing toward their Lord means the people of Paradise await reward after reward and honor after honor.",

Then al-Dahhak and Ibrahim and Makbul and al-Zuhri said: They look toward the reward, and Allah is not seen by anyone from creation. Al-Hasan said: Gazing toward the might of their Lord and His power and management. Gleaming means brightness in faces and joy in hearts. Said ibn Jubayr said: Gleaming means beauty toward their Lord.

He replied: Allah the Most High said: There is no secret counsel of three but He is their fourth, nor of five but He is their sixth, nor of fewer than that nor more but that He is with them wherever they may be. Thus Allah the Most High informed that no place is empty of Him, and that He is present observing in every place, overseeing and managing all affairs, not even a speck is hidden from Him in the heavens or on earth. Allah said: We are nearer to him than his life vein. He also said: He is Allah in the heavens and on earth; He knows your secrets and your declarations and He knows what you earn. He said to Moses and Aaron: Verily, I am with you; I hear and I see. He said: They hide themselves from people but they cannot hide from Allah while He is with them when they plot what is not pleasing of statement. He said: And they comprehend not Him in knowledge. He said: And there is none equal to Him. He said: Do you know of any comparable to Him? He said: He is established upon the Throne. He said: Unto Him ascends the good word and the righteous deed raises it. He said: Are you secure against He who is in the heaven? He said: He manages the affair from the heavens to the earth. And similar verses from the Quran testify that Allah is not absent from any place in the highest heavens and lowest earths, and it is not permissible to take some of the Quran without other parts for one confirms the other, and He is established upon the Throne, and He is All-Aware of all things, and He encompasses all things, without any likening, delimiting, or similitude.",

The verification of this in the language is the statement of one: I am but looking to Allah then to you, meaning he waits for what comes to him from Allah's direction. As for sight, it can occur without eyes. Allah said: Did you not look unto your Lord how He extended the shadow? And: Did you not look at the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord? And: Did you not look at those who went forth from their dwellings? And: Did not man look that We created him from a drop? And: You desired death before you met it, then you saw it while you were looking. This all and its like means knowledge and certainty, not sight of the eyes. The verification of this in Arabic language is when one says: I saw for such a one action and piety and understanding and knowledge and I saw for him manners and recognition, and these things are not directly observed with sight but known and understood by what appears of their signs pointing to them.",

Jabir said: Ibn Abbas and al-Hasan al-Basri said: The goodness in good deed, and the increase in ninefold, as Allah said: Whoever brings a good deed shall have better than it, thus he has ten times its like. Mujahid said: Its like is the goodness, and the increase, he said: forgiveness and pleasure. Al-Sha'bi said: The increase is entry into Paradise. Muhammad ibn Ka'b said: The increase that Allah increases them from honor and reward. Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Layla said: They did good meaning they united Allah. The goodness is Paradise. And the increase is what Allah increases them from His bounty and mercy. Abu Hazim al-Madini said: The increase is the blessings of Allah that He bestowed upon them, He gave it to them, did not hold them accountable for it, and did not treat them as He treated others, but showered them with blessings.",

      "english_translation": "Narrated by Jabir ibn Zayd: Ibn Abbas was asked about the saying of Allah: And they did not value Allah with the value due to Him, and the earth entirely will be in His grasp on the Day of Resurrection. He said: The Jews who were enemies of Allah came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Muhammad, describe your Lord to us. The Prophet ﷺ trembled and said: How can I describe my Lord who created the heavens and the earth? They said: If you were a prophet you would describe Him. Then they said: Is He like this and like that? So Allah sent down refutation of their statement: And they did not value Allah with the value due to Him, meaning they did not glorify Allah with the glorification due to Him. And the earth entirely will be in His grasp meaning in His power. And the heavens are folded in His right hand meaning in His kingdom. How can these wicked ones describe me when they have not seen my heavens nor my earth? Then He glorified Himself saying: Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him, because the description that came from them was association with partners. Ibn Abbas said: Whoever claims that Allah has a little finger or thumb has indeed associated partners, because Allah is not like anything, and if it were as the Jews said, He would not have said: Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate. But they described Him with attributes other than His attributes, so He glorified Himself from what they say. And they said: The saying of Allah: And they did not value Allah with the value due to Him, meaning they did not glorify Allah with glorification due to Him when they said: The earth entirely will be in His grasp and they meant the fingers. And they did not value Allah with the value due to Him when they said: The heavens are folded in His right hand as they mentioned, with delimitation and similitude. Allah said: Glorified, so He glorified Himself from what they say and associate.",

As for His saying: Except that Allah comes to them in clouds from the cloud and the angels, al-Kalbi narrated from Abu Salih saying: He comes to them with His command and judgment to separate between them. And this is the statement of al-Hasan and Mujahid. And likewise His saying: And your Lord came, meaning: with His command and judgment. Ibn Abbas, al-Hasan, Abu Salih, and Amr said: And the meaning of your Lord came means: And the command of your Lord came, meaning His judgment. And Allah said: And indeed We came to them with the Book, meaning: The messengers came to them. And the evidence for that is the saying of Allah in another verse: Do they await except that the angels come to them or that the command of your Lord comes? And Hushaym was asked about that, so he said: They used to say: And the command of your Lord came, meaning His judgment. And He said: Have they not seen that We come to the earth reducing it from its extremities? And He said: So Allah came to their building from the foundations. And He said: So Allah came to them from where they had not reckoned.",
