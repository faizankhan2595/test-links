He said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: There will be liars in the bodies of men after me who come to gatherings and all of them lie against Allah and His Messenger. Those false hadiths and similar things are whispered to these human demons by their brothers, the demons among the jinn, to lead them astray and confuse them in their religion. And he ﷺ said: Indeed, Allah commanded me to teach you from what He has taught me this day, He said: I created my servants to worship Me, but the demons came to them and diverted them from their religion, and commanded them to associate with Me that for which He has not sent down authority, and forbade them what I have allowed them. And Abdullah ibn Dinar said: I was sitting with Abdullah ibn Umar when he asked for water and was brought milk. When he wanted to drink, I said: You are fasting. He said: Allah intended to give me drink but you prevented me. It was said: And Umar, Ibn Masud, and Ubay ibn Ka'b were sitting together. Umar said: Wretchedness precedes the wretched, and he becomes wretched in his mother's womb. Ubay said: It is not so, but rather they become wretched and fortunate by their deeds for which they are praised and blamed. Umar said: You are right. Allah's mercy precedes His anger, and were it not for that, they would perish. And he ﷺ said: Two groups from my Ummah will not receive my intercession on the Day of Judgment, whom Allah has cursed upon the tongues of seventy prophets before me. It was said: Who are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: The Qadariyyah and the Murji'ah. It was said: Who are the Murji'ah? He said: Those who say: Faith is speech without action. And the Qadariyyah are those who commit sins and say: They are from Allah as compulsion, rather, if Allah had willed, we would not have associated partners with Him nor would we have disobeyed. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq was asked about something and he said: I speak according to my opinion. If it is correct, it is from Allah, and if it is wrong, it is from me and from the Satan. It was said: And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to divide among his wives and treat them equitably, saying: O Allah, this is my action in what I control. So do not blame me for what You control and I do not control.",

It was said: And Uqbah ibn Amir al-Juhani said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ led us in the morning prayer and recited, then said: O Uqbah, these two are the best chapters in the Quran and the Psalms and the Gospel and the Torah. And some people have said: They are not from the Quran, so they have lied and sinned. Ibn Abbas said: If anyone were to add to it or decrease from it, he would be considered a disbeliever by the Ummah. And the Quran is as the Prophet ﷺ brought it, with nothing added to it nor anything decreased from it. Indeed, Allah has protected it, so He said: And indeed it is an Mighty Book; falsehood cannot touch it from before it nor from behind it; a Revelation from a Wise, Praised One. The Mighty means that which is so mighty that they cannot come with its like nor its similarity nor anything in its meaning. Allah would never allow anyone to add to it or decrease from it, as it is His Speech and His Proof against His servants, and the Imam of His servants which will be a witness against them on the Day of Judgment. If anything were decreased from it or added to it, that would be evident in its composition such that it would be known that it is not the Quran, because the created beings are not able to come with the like of its composition and its description and its arrangement ever.",

They come to every person in their grave after their death and test them, then question them. Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet ﷺ said: If anyone were saved from the punishment of the grave, it would be Sad ibn Muadh, yet the grave squeezed him such that his ribs were broken. Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet ﷺ said: The martyr is forgiven at the first drop of his blood that falls, and is protected from the punishment of the grave. And he ﷺ said: Whoever dies on the day of Friday is protected from the punishment of the grave. And he ﷺ said: If the martyrs of my Ummah were only those killed by the sword, they would be few. Then he ﷺ said: The one killed is a martyr. And the hadith continues...",

Allah will not remove it from them and will strip them as this twig is stripped, from a twig he held in his hand. And he ﷺ said: If an Abyssinian slave with a mutilated nose is made commander over you, listen and obey him as long as he upholds the Book of Allah among you. And he ﷺ said: O Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad, and O Safiyyah, aunt of Muhammad, redeem yourselves from Allah, for I do not possess for you anything from Allah. So if the Prophet ﷺ said this to his daughter and his aunt, how can anyone else hope to be forgiven when they persist in lewdness without repenting from it?",
