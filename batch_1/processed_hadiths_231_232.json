They trampled, broke, and took them. They came to Umar in his governorship and he was stern with them and rebuked them. Then he said: 'Follow me' until he came to Ali. They came to Ali and he was in his land with a spade in his hand digging the earth. Umar struck him on his arm and said: 'He (the one who named you) Abu Turab did not make a mistake.' The people told the story to Ali ibn Abi Talib, and Ali said: 'Go to female camels in their prime, have them bred by a strong male, and whatever they bear, slaughter it for Allah the Exalted.' Umar said: 'O Abu al-Hasan, some of the eggs become infertile.' Ali replied: 'And some of the camels are infertile too?' And I asked Zayd ibn Ali about the compensation for hunting, and he said: 'It requires compensation.' He said: 'And if you do not find what to slaughter, estimate its value in food, then give it as charity to the poor.' He said: 'And if he does not find what to feed, he fasts in place of every half sa' one day.' And I asked Zayd ibn Ali about the one performing both Hajj and Umrah together (Qarin), and he said: 'Two expiations are upon him.' I asked Zayd ibn Ali: 'If a non-muhrim kills game in the Sacred Precinct, what is upon him?' He said: 'Compensation is upon him.' I said: 'And if a muhrim kills game in the Sacred Precinct?' He said: 'Two expiations are upon him.'\"",
