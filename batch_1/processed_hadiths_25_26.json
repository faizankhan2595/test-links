We departed until when we were on the way, the provisions were exhausted. Abu Ubaidah ordered that the provisions of the army be gathered, and there were two leather bags of dates. He rationed for us each day little by little until it was exhausted, and we only received dates one by one. When they were exhausted, we reached the sea and found a large fish like a mountain. The army ate from it for eighteen nights. Then Abu Ubaidah ordered two of its ribs to be set up, and he ordered his camel to be saddled, then he passed under them without touching them. Abu Ubaidah said: The Prophet ﷺ forbade three types of eating: peeling, taking handfuls of large amounts, and digging. The peeler is one who eats from every side and strips the surface of the food. The one who takes large handfuls is the one who takes mouthfuls beyond capacity. The digger is one who digs in the food and returns to the sauce.",

He was brought roasted lizard (dabb). The Prophet ﷺ reached out his hand to it, but some of the women in the house said: Inform the Prophet ﷺ what he wants to eat. It was said: It is lizard, O Prophet of Allah. He withdrew his hand. Khalid said: I asked: Is it forbidden, O Prophet of Allah? He said: No, but it is not found in the land of my people, so I find myself averse to it. Khalid said: So I pulled it and ate it while the Prophet ﷺ watched.",
