He did not refuse any of it and said to Bilal: 'Take care of these dates until I ask you about them.' Bilal went and exchanged the dates giving two and taking one. When it was the next day, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'Bring us what we hid with you.' When Bilal brought the dates, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked him: 'What is this that we hid with you?' So Bilal informed him of what he had done. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him: 'This is forbidden that which is not proper to eat. Go and return it to its owner and command him not to sell like this nor buy like this.' Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'Gold for gold like for like, silver for silver like for like, wheat for wheat like for like, corn for corn like for like, barley for barley like for like hand to hand, so whoever gives more or takes more has committed riba.' And Zayd ibn Ali said: When the two types differ from what is measured, there is no harm in giving two for one like for like hand to hand and deferment is not allowed. When the two types differ from what is weighed, there is no harm in giving two for one like for like hand to hand and deferment is not allowed. When the two types differ from what is neither measured nor weighed, there is no harm in giving two for one like for like hand to hand and deferment is allowed.",

Abu Khalid said: Zayd ibn Ali explained to us two conditions in a sale, that you say I sold you this commodity on the condition that it is cash at this price or on credit at this price or on the condition that it is at this time for this price and at another time for this price. Or regarding credit with sale, that you lend something and then sell it before you receive it. And regarding selling what is not with you, that you sell the commodity and then buy it after that and deliver it to the one you sold it to. And profit of what is not guaranteed, that a man buys merchandise and then sells it before he receives it and gives the other some of the profit. And selling what has not been received, that a man buys merchandise and then sells it before he receives it. And touching sale: a sale that was in the time of ignorance where two men negotiate over merchandise, so whichever one of them touched the other, the sale became binding and he could not return. And throwing sale: when two men negotiate so whichever one threw it to his companion, the sale became binding. And pebble sale: when two men negotiate, so whichever one threw a pebble, the sale became binding. And hazard sale: selling fish in the water and milk in the udder, and these are sales that were in the time of ignorance.",

If he is satisfied with it, then good, otherwise he returns it and returns with it a measure of dates. And whoever buys a full-uddered animal, he has the option in it for three days. If he is satisfied with it otherwise he returns it and returns with it a measure of dates. Abu Khalid said: Zayd ibn Ali explained to us the misrepresented camel and the full-uddered sheep, which is the one whose milk is left for days.",

He said: The deception is reduced from the buyer but nothing is reduced from him of the profit. And I asked Zayd ibn Ali about a man who bought merchandise and shortened it, or dyed it, or twisted it, then wanted to sell it on mark-up and add to its price what he spent on it. He said: He should not sell that until he clarifies. And I asked Zayd ibn Ali about a man who bought merchandise at a term, then sold it on mark-up while the buyer did not know that he bought it at a term, then knew after that.

And I asked Zayd ibn Ali what is the meaning of this? He said: The reduction for the defect was one-tenth. And I asked Zayd ibn Ali about a man who bought a slave girl and found her to be pregnant. He said: He returns her. I said: If he did not return her until she gave birth to a living or dead child? He said: If the child is alive, if its value equals the reduction for pregnancy or more, he does not return anything, and if it is less he returns the full reduction for pregnancy. And if the child is dead, he returns the full reduction for pregnancy. I asked Zayd ibn Ali about a man who buys a slave girl and finds her to be a runaway, or insane, or urinating on the bed. He said: This is a defect so he returns her. I said: If he presented her for sale? He said: This is not satisfaction. And if he had intercourse with her as if satisfied, or says with his tongue I have accepted her, he said: And if he accepted her for lust, this was not satisfaction. I asked Zayd ibn Ali about a man who bought cloth and cut it into a shirt and sewed it, then found a defect in it. He said: If he did this while knowing, this was satisfaction, and if he did this while not knowing then knew, he returns the reduction for the defect. I asked Zayd ibn Ali about a man who bought merchandise and sold it, then discovered a defect. He said: He returns the reduction of the defect because the seller did not fulfill his condition.",
