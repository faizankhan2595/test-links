When we reached al-Baydah, my necklace broke and fell off. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ halted searching for it, and the people halted with him while they were not near water and had no water with them. They came to Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: Do you see what your daughter has done to the people? She has detained them without water. When Abu Bakr came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ with anger, he said: Do you blame your daughter? The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Do not blame her, for the angel told me that your daughter's necklace will break, and I was commanded to wait for it.",
