I never saw her give charity at all, except that we slaughtered a cow and she gave fat to a poor person in his hand and clothed him with a rag. Then my mother died and my father died. I saw my father at a river giving people water to drink. I said: O father, have you seen my mother? He said: No. Did she die? She said: I said: Yes. Then I went seeking her and found her standing naked with nothing on her except that rag and that fat in her hand. She was striking it against her other hand and sucking its trace and saying: O my thirst! I said: O mother, shall I give you to drink? She said: Yes. So I went to my father and took a vessel from him and gave her water in it... Someone standing near her said: Whoever gave her to drink, may Allah cause his hand to be paralyzed.

The people will extract him from his house unwillingly. They will pledge allegiance to him between the Corner and the Standing Place. An army will be sent against him from the Levant. When they reach al-Baydaa, they will be swallowed up by the earth. Then the groups of Iraq and the righteous ones of the Levant will come to him and pledge allegiance to him. He will extract the treasures and distribute the wealth. Islam will be thrown on its side to the ground. He will live in that for seven years, or as he said, nine years.",
