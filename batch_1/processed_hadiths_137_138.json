They were told this is forbidden, so when Allah revealed this verse regarding them, Allah made the marriage of such women unlawful. Also narrated: From al-Hasan who said regarding the verse: The fornicator who has been punished for fornication - it is not lawful for him to marry except a woman who has been punished for fornication like him.
