Whoever leaves the community even by a hand's span has removed the rope of Islam from his neck until he returns. Whoever calls with the call of ignorance, he is from the coals of Hellfire. A man asked: Even if he prayed and fasted? The Prophet ﷺ replied: Yes, even if he prayed and fasted, unless he names himself with the name by which Allah named you as servants of Allah, the believers.",

He is Hudhayfa ibn al-Yaman, the companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Hudhayfa told the people that people used to ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about good, while I used to ask him about evil. The Prophet ﷺ said: Yes, evil will come after this good just as it came before it. I asked: What is the protection from it? He said: The sword. I asked: What comes after the sword? He said: There will be a rulership over defective people and a truce upon resentment. Then will come callers to misguidance. If Allah has a caliph on earth at that time, he will strike your back and take your wealth, so stick with him; otherwise die while biting a tree root. Then will come the Dajjal after that with a river and fire. Whoever falls in his fire will receive reward and have burden removed, and whoever falls in his river will have burden added and reward removed.

Mu'awiyah said: You will speak with yourself. He said: I did not leave anything to criticize him with except I told him. He said: I am not free from sins. Do you have sins that you fear would destroy you if Allah does not forgive them for you? I said: Yes. He said: What makes you more deserving of forgiveness from me? By Allah, I am not negligent in reconciling people, establishing the boundaries, and jihad in the way of Allah and the great matters which you count as more than what I do. And I am upon a religion where Allah accepts good deeds and pardons evil deeds. By Allah, moreover, I would never choose between Allah and other than Him except to choose Allah over everything else.

He said: What is the rulership of the foolish? He said: Rulers who will come after me, they do not follow my guidance, nor do they follow my Sunnah. Whoever confirms them in their falsehood and helps them in their oppression, those are not from me and I am not from them, and they will not reach my Pool. And whoever does not confirm them in their falsehood and does not help them in their oppression, those are from me and I am from them, and they will reach my Pool, O Ka'b ibn Ujrah. Fasting is a shield, and charity extinguishes sin, and prayer is a means of closeness or evidence. O Ka'b ibn Ujrah, flesh that grows from ill-gotten gain will never enter Paradise, the Fire is more worthy of it. O Ka'b ibn Ujrah, the people are two travelers: one buying himself and freeing himself, or selling himself and destroying himself.",
