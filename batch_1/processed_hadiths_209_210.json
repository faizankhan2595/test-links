And narrated from him: I went out with the Prophet ﷺ when he had purified himself for prayer. He touched his nose with his thumb and behold there was blood. He repeated it once and saw nothing, then he wiped it on the earth. He did not renew his ablution and went to prayer. It was asked to Zayd: What about one whose nosebleed does not stop? He said: He performs ablution for every prayer even if blood flows, and this should be at the end of the prayer time. It was asked to Zayd ibn Ali: What about a man who sleeps during prayer whether he is in bowing, prostration, or sitting? He said: Ablution is not broken.",

And the Prophet ﷺ also said: 'I have been given three things which were not given to any prophet before me. The earth has been made a mosque and a means of purification for me. Allah said (in the Quran): \"So when you do not find water, then take clean soil.\" For me spoils of war are lawful, and this was not lawful for anyone before me. Allah said: \"Know that from the spoils of war, a fifth belongs to Allah and the Messenger and to kindred.\" And I have been helped with terror for a month's journey, and I have been favored over the prophets on the Day of Resurrection with three things: My ummah will come on the Day of Resurrection with faces gleaming and bodies marked with ablution, known among nations, and the muezzins will come on the Day of Resurrection with the longest necks, calling with the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and messenger. And the third: There is no prophet except that he will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection for a sin, but not me, due to His saying: \"So Allah may forgive you for what has passed of your sins and what is to come.\"'",

He said: One performs ablution from his drinking water, but not from his ablution water, unless it is known that he drank wine or ate pork, then one does not perform ablution from his drinking water nor his ablution water. I asked Zayd ibn Ali about tale-bearing and backbiting breaking ablution? He said: No. Zayd ibn Ali said regarding insects that die in the vessel: There is no harm in it. I asked Zayd about a man performing ablution twice? He said: It is sufficient. I said: And if he performed ablution once? He said: It is sufficient.
