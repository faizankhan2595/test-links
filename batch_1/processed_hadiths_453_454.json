If he arrives with it after the ten have begun, then he may not do so until he stands (at Arafat). Also narrated from Matar from Ata' with similar wording, and it is the statement of Qatadah. Also narrated by Qatadah from Anas ibn Malik: That he used to send sacrificial animals and did not refrain from what the muhrim (one in ihram) refrains from. And from Qatadah: That al-Hasan used to issue a legal opinion with that, he did not refrain.",
