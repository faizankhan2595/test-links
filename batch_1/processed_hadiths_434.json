A man came to Hudhayfah ibn Asid and said: You are sitting here while the people of Kufa are fighting the Dajjal. Hudhayfah said to him: Sit down. Then their leader came and said: You both are sitting here while the people of Kufa are confronting the Dajjal. Hudhayfah said: Sit down. They remained for a short while, then another person came and said: It is a lie of a dyer. The people said to Hudhayfah: Tell us about the Dajjal, for you would not have held us back except if you had knowledge about it. Hudhayfah said: If the Dajjal were to come out today, the boys would bury him with pebbles. But he will come out when there is scarcity of people, lack of food, and discord among them, and weakness of religion. The earth will be folded for him like the skin of a sheep. He will come to Madinah and will take those outside it while preventing those inside. The word Kafir (Disbeliever) is written between his eyes, which every believer, literate or illiterate, will read. He will not be allowed to ride anything but a donkey, and he is filth upon filth.",

I said: You lie; you do not know while it is in your head? He wiped it, and he snorted three times. The Jewish man claimed that I struck his chest with my hand, but I do not know if I did that. Get out, you will not exceed your measure. He said: Yes, by my life, I will not exceed my measure.

      "english_translation": "Narrated by al-Zuhri from Amr ibn Abi Sufyan al-Thaqafi from an Ansari man from some of the companions of Muhammad ﷺ: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ mentioned the Dajjal and said: The Dajjal will come to the wastelands of Madinah, and it is forbidden for him to enter its passages. Madinah will shake with its inhabitants one or two shakes, which is the earthquake. Every hypocrite, male and female, will come out to him. Then the Dajjal will turn toward Syria until he comes to some of the mountains of Syria and will besiege them. The remaining believers will be on the peak of a mountain of the mountains of Syria, and the Dajjal will besiege them at its base. When the trial becomes prolonged for them, a man from the Muslims will say: O Muslims, how long will you remain like this? While the enemy of Allah is on your land like this! Are you not between one of two good things: either Allah will martyr you or give you victory? They will pledge to die, a pledge which Allah knows is true from their souls. Then darkness will take them where no one can see his hand. Jesus son of Mary will descend and remove the veil from their eyes, and among them will be a man wearing a garment. They will ask: Who are you, O servant of Allah? He will say: I am the servant of Allah and His Messenger, His spirit and His word, Jesus son of Mary. Choose between one of three: Either Allah will send punishment from heaven on the Dajjal and his troops, or He will cause the earth to swallow them, or He will give power to your weapons and withhold their weapons from you. They will say: This, O Messenger of Allah, is most pleasing to our hearts. On that day, you will see the great tall Jew, the eater and drinker, whose hand cannot lift his sword from trembling. The Muslims will rise against them and overpower them, and the Dajjal will melt when he sees the son of Mary like lead melts, until Jesus reaches him and kills him.",
