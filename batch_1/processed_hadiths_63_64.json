When he is placed in his grave, two angels come to him whose voices are like the sound of splitting thunder and whose sight is like flashing lightning. They make him sit up and say to him: Who is your Lord? What is your religion? Who is your prophet? If he was a believer, he says: Allah is my Lord, Islam is my religion, and Muhammad is my prophet. He is told: Upon this you lived and upon this you died and upon this you will be resurrected. Look to your left. A door to the Fire is opened for him, and he is told: This is your dwelling if you had disobeyed Allah. But since you obeyed Him, look to your right. A door to Paradise is opened for him and he sees the coolness of his dwelling and its pleasure. He wishes to rise up, but he is told: It is not yet time. Sleep soundly, sleep the sleep of a bride. There is nothing more beloved to him than the standing of the Hour until he returns to his family and wealth and to the Paradise of bliss. But if he was a disbeliever, they make him sit up and say: Who is your Lord? He says: I do not know. They say: What do you say of this man, meaning Muhammad ﷺ? He says: I used to say what the people say. They say: You did not know and did not recite. Upon this you lived, and upon this you died, and upon this you will be resurrected. Look to your right. A door from Paradise is opened for him, and he is told: This is your dwelling if you had obeyed Allah. But since you disobeyed Him, look to your left. A door to Hellfire is opened for him from his grave, and the gloom of his dwelling and its suffering enter upon him. There is nothing more abhorrent to him than the standing of the Hour, thus he turns to the punishment.",

Jabir swears at this point: There is no intercession for the people of major sins, because Allah has threatened the people of major sins in His Book. And if the hadith came from Anas ibn Malik that intercession reaches the people of major sins, then by Allah, he did not mean murder and fornication and sorcery and what Allah has threatened the Fire for. And he mentioned that Anas ibn Malik said: You are indeed doing deeds which are more subtle in your eyes than a hair, that we would not have considered during the time of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ except from the major sins. And it was mentioned to us in the hadith of intercession: The people of faith are detained in the place after they were given good news at the time of death and after they responded during the test in the graves, that their Lord Allah has forgiven them, and they receive their books in their right hands, and their faces become white, and their scales become heavy. Allah wanted to enter them into Paradise through intercession, and intercession is hidden - no prophet nor angel reaches it until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ opens it. The prophets and those who followed them are detained, the first and the last. So while they are like this, they say: If only we had interceded with our Lord so He would relieve us from this place. Some say to others: Come to Adam. They come to him and say: You are the one whom Allah created with His hand, and breathed into you of His spirit, and commanded His angels to prostrate to you. If you would intercede for us with your Lord so He would relieve us from this place. He says: I ate from the tree that Allah forbade me from, and I feel shy to meet my Lord, but go to Noah, for he is the first prophet Allah sent. They come to Noah and say: If you would intercede for us with your Lord. He says: I asked my Lord what I had no knowledge of, and I feel shy to meet my Lord, but go to Abraham, the Intimate of the Merciful. They come to him and say: If you would intercede for us with your Lord. He says: I feel shy to meet my Lord, but go to Moses, the One who spoke to Allah. They come to him and say: If you would intercede for us with your Lord. He says: I killed a soul, so I feel shy to meet my Lord, but go to Jesus, for he is the Spirit of Allah and His Word. They come to him and say: If you would intercede for us with your Lord. He says: I was worshipped besides Allah, so I feel shy to meet my Lord, but go to Muhammad ﷺ, a servant to whom Allah has forgiven what came before of his sins and what will come after. The Prophet ﷺ said: They come to me, and I walk between two rows of the believers, and I knock on the door of Paradise. When it is opened for me, then I am told: O Muhammad, intercede and it will be granted to you. He says: O Lord, none remain except those whom the Quran has detained, meaning: against whom the Quran has made eternity in the Fire inevitable. The scholars said: This is the Praised Position that the first and the last will praise Him in it, as Allah saved them from that position, and the first praise Him for opening intercession to them, and it was hidden - no one reaches it until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ opens it. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ intercedes, Adam intercedes at a time appointed for him regarding his children, then the prophets intercede, each prophet interceding for his nation, and the believers intercede, and thus Allah willed to enter the believers into Paradise through intercession, to such an extent that we have heard that the martyr intercedes for seventy of his household if they are believers and God-conscious.",
