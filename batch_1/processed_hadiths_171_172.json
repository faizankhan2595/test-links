Mujahid said: This means the Bedouins of Madinah, Juhaynah and Muzaynah tribes. When the Prophet ﷺ intended to go to Makkah, he called them to join him, saying: We will go with you against a people who came to you and killed your companions, so we will fight them in their land. But they made excuses due to their preoccupation. The Prophet ﷺ proceeded as a pilgrim (Umrah). His Companions seized some people from the people of the Haram unaware. The Prophet ﷺ then released them. That was the victory at the interior of Makkah, which is His saying: 'With victory at the interior of Makkah after He gave you victory over them' from Surah al-Fath verse 24. The Prophet ﷺ returned while Allah the Mighty and Majestic had promised him great spoils and hastened for him Khaybar. The ones left behind said: Let us follow you. These were the spoils about which Allah the Mighty and Majestic said: 'When you set out to take the spoils, let those who believe follow you' from Surah al-Fath verse 15. And there were presented to them fighting against people of strong military might, they are Persia and Rome. But as for the great spoils which they were promised, they did not obtain them until today.",

This means what springs forth by the side of a field. The first one becomes firm and the other becomes firm. Then he aided it from Surah al-Fath verse 29. This means he strengthened it and helped it.
