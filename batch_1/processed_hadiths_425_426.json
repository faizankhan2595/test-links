Whoever leaves the community even by a hand's span has removed the rope of Islam from his neck until he returns. Whoever calls with the call of ignorance, he is from the coals of Hellfire. A man asked: Even if he prayed and fasted? The Prophet ﷺ replied: Yes, even if he prayed and fasted, unless he names himself with the name by which Allah named you as servants of Allah, the believers.",

He is Hudhayfa ibn al-Yaman, the companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Hudhayfa told the people that people used to ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about good, while I used to ask him about evil. The Prophet ﷺ said: Yes, evil will come after this good just as it came before it. I asked: What is the protection from it? He said: The sword. I asked: What comes after the sword? He said: There will be a rulership over defective people and a truce upon resentment. Then will come callers to misguidance. If Allah has a caliph on earth at that time, he will strike your back and take your wealth, so stick with him; otherwise die while biting a tree root. Then will come the Dajjal after that with a river and fire. Whoever falls in his fire will receive reward and have burden removed, and whoever falls in his river will have burden added and reward removed.

Mu'awiyah said: You will speak with yourself. He said: I did not leave anything to criticize him with except I told him. He said: I am not free from sins. Do you have sins that you fear would destroy you if Allah does not forgive them for you? I said: Yes. He said: What makes you more deserving of forgiveness from me? By Allah, I am not negligent in reconciling people, establishing the boundaries, and jihad in the way of Allah and the great matters which you count as more than what I do. And I am upon a religion where Allah accepts good deeds and pardons evil deeds. By Allah, moreover, I would never choose between Allah and other than Him except to choose Allah over everything else.

Whoever confirms them in their falsehood and helps them in their oppression, those are not from me and I am not from them, and they will not reach my Pool. And whoever does not confirm them in their falsehood and does not help them in their oppression, those are from me and I am from them, and they will reach my Pool, O Ka'b ibn Ujrah. Fasting is a shield, and charity extinguishes sin, and prayer is a means of closeness or evidence. O Ka'b ibn Ujrah, flesh that grows from ill-gotten gain will never enter Paradise, the Fire is more worthy of it. O Ka'b ibn Ujrah, the people are two travelers: one buying himself and freeing himself, or selling himself and destroying himself.",

When Sa'id saw that Umar was serious and would not leave him, he gave him advice saying: Fear Allah, O Umar! Establish your face and your judgment for those who entrusted you from close and distant Muslims. Love for people what you love for yourself and your family, and hate for them what you hate for yourself and your family. Do not judge with two judgments in one matter, so your opinion becomes confused and you deviate from truth. Wade into difficult matters for the sake of truth and do not fear any blame in the way of Allah. Umar said: Who can bear that, O Sa'id?

I said: Wa alaikum assalam, enter. When he entered, behold it was Abdullah ibn Mas'ud. I said: Abu Abd al-Rahman, what time of visiting is this (meaning it was midday)? He said: The day became long for me, so I remembered whom to speak with. He narrated to me from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and I narrated to him. Then he began narrating to me, saying: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: There will be a tribulation. The sleeping in it is better than the reclining, the reclining better than the sitting, the sitting better than the standing, the standing better than the walking, the walking better than the riding, and the riding better than the running. All those killed in it are in the Fire. I said: O Messenger of Allah, when will that be? He said: In the days of chaos (harj). I said: And when are the days of chaos? He said: When a man does not trust his companion. I said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you command me if I reach that time? He said: Guard yourself and your hand and enter your house. I said: O Messenger of Allah, what if a man enters my house? He said: Enter your house. I said: O Messenger of Allah, what if a man enters my house? He said: Enter your mosque and do this, and he placed his right hand on his left wrist, and say: My Lord is Allah, until you die on that.",
