There were not twenty white hairs in his head and beard. (Second part:) Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, was married to the Prophet ﷺ when she was six years old, and he consummated the marriage when she was nine years old. She was the only virgin he married from among his wives. She died after him having lived for forty-eight years. She died during the time of Mu'awiyah in Ramadan of the year fifty-eight.
