He said: 'No, by Allah, I do not have the strength for it.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'Then go and feed sixty poor people.' He said: 'No, by Allah, I do not have the strength for it.' Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered for him fifteen sacks, with each poor person receiving a measure. He said: 'O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, by the One Who sent you with the truth as a prophet, there is no household between the two boundaries of this city more needy than ours!'

      "english_translation": "From Ali: (Discussion on expiation of oaths) The Prophet's ﷺ guidance on giving sustenance - providing breakfast and dinner half a measure of wheat, semolina, flour, or a measure of dates or barley. Regarding Allah's statement 'from what you feed your families' - the moderate includes bread with butter or oil, the best being bread with meat, and the least being bread with salt. Regarding clothing - providing a garment sufficient for prayer. (From Zaid ibn Ali's discussion): When a man swears by Allah - by Allah, with Allah, or by Allah - then breaks his oath, he must expiate. If he says 'I swear' or 'I testify' without mentioning Allah, there is no breach. If he says he is Jewish, Christian, Magian, or disbelieves in Islam then breaks his oath, there is nothing upon him. If he says 'I have a vow if I speak to so-and-so' and speaks to him, there is nothing upon him unless he says 'For Allah I have a vow.' Details regarding different types of oaths and their expiations. If a man can only find one poor person, he cannot distribute ten days of food to him as one (it only counts as feeding one). If a man breaks his oath while poor and fasts, then finds provisions on the third day before sunset, his fasting is annulled and he must provide sustenance instead. The people of the covenant cannot be given expiation-required foods. Various rulings on swearing oaths regarding food transformations - that distinction is made between substantial change and appearance change. Questions about oaths sworn by children who later mature, or by disbelievers who later convert - Islam nullifies what came before it. The basis of people's oaths is according to their intention and custom of their land.",
