Abu Bakr asked: 'O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, where shall I be at that time?' He replied: 'Under the earth.' Then Umar stood and asked: 'O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, where shall I be at that time?' He said: 'Under the earth.' Then Uthman stood and asked: 'O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, where shall I be at that time?' He replied: 'You will open through it and conflict will arise through it.' Then Ali stood and asked: 'O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, where shall I be at that time?' He said: 'You are their Imam and their guide, walking through it like a camel in its tether.'",

The other man said he obtained it from a share of war booty. The Ansari brought him to the Prophet ﷺ. The Prophet ﷺ said to him: 'Seek war booty from sources other than your brother's property.' Regarding a horse, the Muslim are one hand, supporting each other. Regarding the verse 'The adulterer shall not marry except an adulteress or a polytheist...' (Surah An-Nur 24:3), Aflah narrated from the Prophet ﷺ: 'The adulterer who has been whipped does not marry except an adulteress who has been whipped, and the adulteress who has been whipped is not married except to an adulterer who has been whipped, and this is forbidden to the believers.' The Imam narrated regarding the Prophet's ﷺ method that he did not perform qunut at all during his prayer, nor did the two caliphs after him.",

When they came to the Prophet ﷺ, they informed him that their leader only prayed with them using al-Fatihah and Surah al-Ikhlas and did not recite anything else in all his prayers. The Prophet ﷺ asked him: 'Do you have something from the Quran?' He replied: 'Yes.' He said: 'What prevented you from reciting it in your prayer?' He said: 'O Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I love Surah al-Ikhlas with a strong love.' The Prophet ﷺ remained silent, then turned to the man and said: 'Indeed, Allah loves you for your love of Surah al-Ikhlas.' The Imam also reported from the scholars among us: The Prophet ﷺ entered the mosque and saw people raising their hands in prayer like the tails of wild horses, so he said: 'What is with these people raising their hands in prayer like the tails of wild horses?

Umar said: 'O Hudhayfah, a man from the Muslims, from the companions of Muhammad ﷺ dies and you do not witness his funeral?' Hudhayfah said: 'O Commander of the Faithful, did you not know that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ confided a secret to me?' Umar said: 'I adjure you by Allah, was he among them?' He said: 'O Allah, yes.' So he said: 'I adjure you by Allah, am I among them?' He said: 'No, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, and I will never reassure anyone after you.' It was said to Jabir ibn Zayd: 'Do you fear hypocrisy?' He said: 'And how can I not fear it when Umar ibn al-Khattab feared it?'",

    "english_translation": "Narrated by Jabir ibn Zayd that a man came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who was from his maternal uncles, and his name was Dimam ibn Tha'labah. He said to him: 'O Messenger of Allah, I am from your maternal uncles, from Banu Jushaym.' The Prophet ﷺ had been nursed among them. He said: 'I will question you and be strict in my questioning, so do not take offense.' The Prophet ﷺ said to him: 'Ask about your need.' He said: 'Who created you and created those before you and will create those after you?' He said: 'Allah.' He said: 'I adjure you by Him, did He send you?' The Prophet of Allah said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Who created the seven heavens and seven earths, and who provides sustenance between them?' He said: 'Allah.' He said: 'I adjure you by Him, did He send you?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Your messengers informed us and we found in your books that we should pray five prayers each day and night. I adjure you by Him, did He command you with this?' The Prophet ﷺ said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Your messengers informed us and we found in your books that you should take Zakat from our wealthy and place it among our poor. I adjure you by Him, did He command you?' The Prophet ﷺ said: 'O Allah, yes.' He said: 'Your messengers informed us and we found in your books that we should fast the month of Ramadan each year. I adjure you by Him, did He command you with this?' He said ﷺ: 'O Allah, yes.' He said: 'Your messengers informed us and we found in your books that we should perform Hajj to the House of Allah if we find provision and transportation. I adjure you by Allah, did He command you with this?' He said: 'O Allah, yes.' The man said: 'And the fifth, I have no desire to ask you about it,' meaning the prohibited things. He said: 'If you had permitted them, the world would not survive by them, and if you had not forbidden them, the religion would not stand by them.' Then he said: 'I am returning to my people and will act according to them, and whoever follows me from my people.' The Prophet ﷺ said when he departed: 'If the man is truthful, he will enter Paradise.'",
