Al-Dahhak said: 'No one does this except one who is ignorant of Allah's command.' Sa'd said: 'That is a bad saying.' Al-Dahhak said: 'Indeed, Umar ibn al-Khattab forbade this.' Sa'd said: 'The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did it and we did it with him.' Al-Rabi' said: Abu Ubaydah said: Whoever desired to combine Umrah with Hajj, let him do it, and whoever wished to leave it, let him leave it, and all of that is permissible.",

It was mentioned to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and he said: 'Leave it; its owner will soon come to it.' The Bahzi came, and he was its owner, and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, this is our donkey.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered Abu Bakr to divide it among the companions. Then he continued until he was at al-Uthayah between al-Ruwaythah and al-'Arj (which are places). He saw a gazelle lying in the shade with an arrow in it. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered a man to stand by it and not to disturb it so that no one would harm it until he passed by it. Al-Rabi' said: The lame one (al-'aqir) and the maimed (al-ma'qur) and the lying down one in the shade (al-haqif) in the shadow of the resting place (al-muhtaqaf) is the one that stays in the place of the desolate land. And his statement: 'not to disturb it' means: not to harm it.",

She said: I arrived at Mecca while menstruating, so I did not circumambulate the House nor between al-Safa and al-Marwah. I complained about this to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He said: 'Undo your hair, comb it, and enter into the sacred state for Hajj and leave the Umrah.' She said: I did so. When I completed the Hajj, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent me with Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr to al-Tan'im and I performed Umrah. He said: 'This is the place of your Umrah.' She said: Those who entered into sacred state for Umrah circumambulated the House and between al-Safa and al-Marwah, then exited the sacred state, then circumambulated again after returning from Mina for their Hajj. But those who entered into sacred state for Hajj or combined Hajj and Umrah only circumambulated once.",

Al-Rabi' said: Ibn Abbas said: The Prophet ﷺ said: 'The martyr is forgiven at the first drop of his blood spilled in the way of Allah, and is protected from the torment of the grave.' And he said ﷺ: 'If the martyrs of my nation were only those killed by the sword, they would be few.' Then he said ﷺ: 'The slain is a martyr, the one crushed by building is a martyr, the one suffering intestinal disease is a martyr, the one who drowns is a martyr, the one eaten by wild beasts is a martyr, the one bitten is a martyr (meaning from snake), the one suffering from tuberculosis is a martyr, the one who dies guarding the way of Allah is a martyr, the one who remembers Allah when taking his bed and then dies is a martyr, the woman who dies in childbirth is a martyr, and the one who dies on his bed intending that the word of Allah be the highest and the word of the disbelievers be the lowest is a martyr.'",
