Calamity will be poured upon them continuously, so their hearts will disbelieve, their joys will be changed, and their veils will be torn. Indeed, by their sins their adversaries will be revealed, their pegs will be pulled out, their ropes will be cut. Woe to Quraysh from a zindiq (heretic) who brings innovations, denies their religion with a word similar to this, and their sanctity will be taken, their walls will be demolished, their armies will be defeated. At that time the mourning women will rise - wailing women - some crying over their religion, some over their worldly life, some from their humiliation after honor, some from hunger of their children, some from slaying of their children in their wombs, some from degradation of their necks, some from violation of their private parts, some from shedding of their blood, some in fear of their armies, some longing for their graves.'",
