Neither benefit does family lineage bring to one of you from it. Whoever Allah wills good for, He grants him understanding in the religion. Then he said: I heard these words from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ upon this pulpit, meaning the minbar.",

Then you look at the arrow shaft and see nothing. Then you look at the feathers and see nothing, and you doubt about the nocking point of the arrow. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said this hadith about the Khawarij (those who rebel against the true religion). The Rabi' said: The arrowhead is the iron tip, the arrow shaft is the arrow which has the iron tip, the arrow feathers are what the bowstring is placed upon. It is also narrated: You look at the reddish part and see nothing, and the reddish part is the head of the arrow.",

I wish I could see my brothers. They said: Are we not your brothers, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Rather, you are my companions. My brothers are those who come after me, and I am their precursor at the Pond. They said: O Messenger of Allah, how will you know those who come after you? He said: Do you not see that if a man had white-marked horses among dark horses, would he not recognize his horses? They said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: They will come on the Day of Judgment with white marks from the traces of ablution, and I am their precursor at the Pond. Certainly, some men will be driven away from my Pond as the stray camel is driven away. I will call them, but it will be said: They have changed things after you. Then I will say: Woe, woe to them.",
