Its rivers are flowing, its fruits are hanging, and its birds are flexible. There is neither sun nor bitter cold. Each man of its people has a thousand beautiful women, and he remains with the beautiful woman from his beautiful women for a thousand years, never tiring of her nor she of him. And indeed the lowest of the inhabitants of Paradise in rank is he upon whom is bestowed every morning and evening ten thousand dishes of food, each dish having a flavor different from the other. And indeed the man of the inhabitants of Paradise, there passes by him a bird, and he desires it, and it falls between his hands either cooked or roasted as he desires from the desire that entered his heart. And indeed the man of the inhabitants of Paradise is in a garden of his gardens among all types of trees, when he desires a fruit from those fruits, it is lowered to him. And if one of their beautiful women appeared to the people of the earth, she would outshine the light of the sun, and would have caused the people of the earth to be tempted.",
