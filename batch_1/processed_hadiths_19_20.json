He ordered the people to break their fast, saying: \"For strengthening against your enemy.\" He fasted and did not break it. We saw the Messenger of Allah ﷺ pouring water on his head from the intensity of heat or thirst. It was said to him: O Messenger of Allah, some people have fasted while you have been fasting. When he reached al-Kadid, he called for a drink of water and drank it, and the people broke their fast with him.' || Narrated by Anas ibn Malik: 'We traveled with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and among us were those who fasted and those who broke their fast. Neither the one who fasted blamed the one who broke his fast, nor did the one who broke his fast blame the one who fasted.'",
