He sent people to ask Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, about it. Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said to them: What is this like in Iraq? Be truthful with me. They informed him of the matter. He said: May Allah curse a people who are satisfied with our judgment while making fighting against us permissible. Then he said: Look at where he urinates. If he urinates from where a man urinates, then he is a man. If he urinates from where a woman urinates, then he is a woman. They said: O Commander of the Believers, he urinates from both places. He said: Then he has half the share of a man and half the share of a woman.",
