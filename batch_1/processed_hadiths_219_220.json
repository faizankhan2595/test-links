He did not perform obligatory prayers or Witr except when he alighted.

When the leader raises his head from the second prostration, they should position themselves behind them, and another group who have not yet prayed should come to pray with him. The first group retreats and takes the position of their companions. He then prays with the second group one rak'ah and two prostrations, then gives the salam. The two groups then stand, the first group completes one rak'ah and two prostrations then gives salam.
