He said: He prostrates with the imam, then he rises and completes his prayer. I asked him about a traveler leading both residents and travelers in one rak'ah, then the imam is afflicted with an ailment such as nosebleed, so he appoints a resident to lead the remaining prayer of the traveler, then appoints a traveler to conclude with taslim.

When it reaches five, the zakat is one sheep. Then nothing until it reaches ten, when the zakat is two sheep. When it reaches fifteen, the zakat is three sheep. When it reaches twenty, the zakat is four sheep. When it reaches twenty-five, the zakat is five sheep. When it increases by one beyond that, the zakat is a young she-camel in her first year of breeding. If that is not available, then a young male camel one year older. This continues with increasing thresholds: at thirty-five, a young she-camel in her second year; at forty-five, a mature she-camel; at sixty, a pregnant she-camel; at seventy-five, a three-year-old she-camel; at ninety, two young she-camels in their second year; at one hundred and twenty, two mature she-camels. When camels become numerous, for every fifty a mature she-camel is due.",

Also narrated: I asked Zayd ibn Ali about zakat on jewelry. He said: Pay zakat on gold and silver, but there is no zakat on pearls, rubies, or other precious stones. I asked Zayd ibn Ali about the wealth of an orphan - is there zakat on it? He said: No. I said: But the family of Abu Rafi narrate from Ali that he paid zakat on their wealth. He said: We of the Prophet's family reject this. I asked Zayd ibn Ali about what comes from the sea such as amber and pearls. He said: There is nothing on that. I asked Zayd ibn Ali about mines of gold, silver, lead, iron, quicksilver, and copper. He said: There is a fifth on those. I asked him about mines of precious stones like agate. He said: There is nothing on those. I asked him about a mukatab slave - is there zakat on him? He said: No. I asked him: Can zakat be given to one of your relatives? He said: It cannot be given to one upon whom the Imam has imposed maintenance, and all heirs are those upon whom the Imam has imposed maintenance. Zayd ibn Ali said: Do not give from your zakat to the Qadariyyah, the Murji'ah, the Kharijites, nor to those who wage war against the Prophet's family, peace be upon them. I asked Zayd ibn Ali about accelerating zakat before its time is due. He said: It is permissible. I asked him about a man who has one hundred fifty dirhams and five dinars. He said: Zakat is due on that. But if either category is below the minimum, no zakat is due on any of them. Zayd ibn Ali said: It is not permissible to give zakat to the people of the covenant, nor is it lawful to give them zakat from obligatory charity. Zayd ibn Ali said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ obligated charity on ten things: gold and silver, wheat and barley, dates and raisins, corn, camels, cattle, and sheep. Zayd ibn Ali said: Zakat cannot be used for the shroud of a dead person, for building a mosque, nor to free a slave. Zayd ibn Ali said: Zakat is distributed among the eight categories mentioned by Allah in His Book, and if you give it to only one category, it suffices you.",

One must give it for oneself and for all those in one's household: half a sa' of wheat, or one sa' of dates, or one sa' of barley. Also narrated: I asked Zayd about a man who has less than fifty dirhams. He said: Zakat of Fitr is not obligatory on him. One who has fifty dirhams cannot take Zakat of Fitr, and Zakat of Fitr is obligatory on one who has fifty dirhams. I asked Zayd about the measure of sa' - what is its quantity? He said: Five and one-third ratlal using the Kufa ratlal (measure of weight).",
