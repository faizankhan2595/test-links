When we returned and people prepared to disperse, I said: O Abu Bakr, a man who accompanied you as long as he did, then left you without gaining any good from you - I have a good opinion of it. So advise me and do not be lengthy lest I forget. He said: May Allah have mercy on you, May Allah have mercy on you, may Allah bless you, may Allah bless you. Perform the prescribed prayer at its proper time, and give the Zakat of your wealth with a cheerful heart, and fast Ramadan, and make pilgrimage to the House, and know that migration in Islam is good, and that striving (in jihad) in migration is good, and do not be an official. I said: As for your words O Abu Bakr regarding prayer, fasting, zakat, pilgrimage, migration, and striving - all of this is good that I know. But as for your words that I should not be an official - by Allah, it seems to me that the best of you today are your officials. He said: You asked me not to be lengthy, and this is when I will be lengthy with you. This governance (authority) that appears trivial today is about to spread and become corrupt until it reaches those who are not worthy of it. And whoever becomes an official will indeed have a long account and severe punishment, and whoever is not an official will indeed have an easy account and lighter punishment, because officials are the closest people to oppressing the believers. Whoever oppresses the believers has thereby violated Allah. They are indeed neighbors of Allah and guests of Allah. And by Allah, one of you may have his neighbor's sheep or camel harmed, and he spends the night with swollen muscles, saying: My neighbor's sheep, my neighbor's camel. So Allah is more deserving of anger for His neighbors.",

Later, when Umar called him to appoint him again, he refused to work for him. Umar said: Do you refuse to work when someone better than you, Yusuf, sought work? Abu Hurayrah said: Yusuf is a Prophet, son of a Prophet, son of a Prophet. And I am Abu Hurayrah, son of Umaymah. I fear three and two. Umar said to him: Why do you not say five?
