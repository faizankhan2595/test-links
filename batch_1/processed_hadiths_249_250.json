The forbidden matters we hold back on, so we say: 'What did you intend?' If he says: 'I intended one,' it counts as one binding divorce, and she is wholly in her own possession. If he says: 'I intended three,' it is forbidden until she marries another husband.

And I asked him about divorce in Persian and Coptic, he said: Divorce in every language. And I asked him about a man who divorces in his heart without speaking it, he said: It does not occur. And I asked him about a man who says to his wife: You are divorced if Allah wills, or he says to his slave: You are free if Allah wills. He said: His wife is not divorced and his slave is not emancipated. And I asked him about a man who says to his wife: You are divorced and divorced and divorced. He said: If he has consummated the marriage with her, it is three. If he has not consummated, it is one.
