    "english_translation": "Narrated by Abu Hurayrah: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked: Do you know what this is above you? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: It is the sky (al-Raqi'), a preserved ceiling and waves confined. Do you know how far is between you and it? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: Between you and it is a journey of five hundred years, and between it and the next heaven is the same. Until he counted seven heavens, and the thickness of each heaven is a journey of five hundred years. Then he said: Do you know what is above that? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: Above that is the Throne ('Arsh), and between it and the seventh heaven is a journey of five hundred years. Then he said: Do you know what is beneath you? They said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: It is the earth, and between it and the earth beneath it is a journey of five hundred years. Until he counted seven earths, and the thickness of each earth is a journey of five hundred years. Then he said: By the One in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if you lowered one of you with a rope to the seventh earth, he would come down upon Allah the Mighty and Majestic. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited: He is the First and the Last, the Apparent and the Hidden, from Surah Al-Hadid verse 3.",
