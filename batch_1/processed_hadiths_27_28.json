Also narrated by Ibn Abbas: I disputed with al-Miswar ibn Makhramah at al-Abyaa' saying that a muhrim washes his head while he said he does not. Ibn Abbas sent a man named Abdullah ibn Hunayn to Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. The man found him bathing between the two raised mounds and he was covering himself with cloth. The man greeted him and asked: Who is this? The man replied: I am a messenger from Ibn Abbas to you, asking you how the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to bathe while in ihram? The man said: Abu Ayyub placed his hand on the cloth and lowered it until his head became visible, then he said to a person pouring water: Pour it (on my head). The person poured on his head and then Abu Ayyub moved his hands on it, bringing them forward and backward. Then he said: This is how I saw him (the Prophet ﷺ) do it - the blessings of Allah be upon him. Al-Rabi' explained: Al-Qarnaan (the two raised mounds) are two smooth poles at al-Abyaa' which are on the edge of the well.",

He gives life and causes death, and He is omnipotent. And he did the same on al-Marwa three times each. When he descended from al-Safa, he walked until his feet descended into the valley, then he ran until he exited from it.

So I see no harm for anyone not to circumambulate them. Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said: No, how strange! If the matter was as you say, it would have been: it is no sin upon him that he does not circumambulate them. Rather, this verse was revealed concerning the Ansar. They used to become consecrated (for Hajj) from Manat, and Manat was a pagan idol behind Qudaid. They used to abstain from circumambulating between al-Safa and al-Marwa because of reverence to Manat. When Islam came, they asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about that, so Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, revealed: Verily al-Safa and al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. Al-Rabi' explained: Manat is a stone at Qudaid which the pagan Arabs used to worship. Abu Ubaidah from Jabir ibn Zayd said: A man came to Abdullah ibn Umar and said: O father of Abdur-Rahman, I saw you doing four things that I did not see anyone of your companions doing.

    "english_translation": "Narrated by Abu Sa'id al-Khudri: Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan wrote to Aisha, Mother of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with her), saying: 'Abdullah ibn Abbas says that whoever sends a sacrificial animal (hadi), whatever is forbidden for a pilgrim becomes forbidden for him until he slaughters his animal. I have sent my sacrificial animal, so write to me with your instruction.' Aisha said: 'It is not as Ibn Abbas said. I twisted the garlands for the Prophet's ﷺ sacrificial animals with my own hands, then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ garlanded them and sent them with my father (Abu Bakr). Nothing that Allah had made lawful for him became forbidden until the sacrificial animal was slaughtered.'",

When we approached Makkah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered those who did not have a sacrificial animal to exit ihram after performing Tawaf around the House and Sa'i between Safa and Marwah. She said: 'Beef was brought to us on the Day of Sacrifice (Yawm al-Nahr), so I asked: What is this meat? They said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ slaughtered (cattle) on behalf of his wives.'",
