He (Ali) said: And Witr is not obligatory and a slave should not intentionally abandon it. Whoever thinks he can finish his Witr, the two rak'ahs of Fajr, and the Fajr prayer before sunrise should do so, and let him begin with Witr. I asked Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, about a man who sleeps during his Witr or forgets it. Zayd said: He performs Witr during the day.

So Bilal stayed awake some times standing and some times sitting until before dawn his eyes overpowered him and he slept. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not wake up except with the heat of the sun. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded the people and they performed ablution and commanded Bilal and he gave the call, then he prayed two rak'ahs, then commanded Bilal, then he led them in the Fajr prayer. He said: I asked Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, about a man who forgets Zuhr and then remembers it during Asr time. He said: If it is at the beginning of the time, he starts with Zuhr then Asr, and if it is at the end of the time, he starts with Asr. He (Ali) said: No prayer is valid when he has another prayer, except at the end of its time. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: If he does not know until he has completed Asr, then knows, he repeats Zuhr and does not repeat Asr.",

Abdullah ibn Rawahah said: O Messenger of Allah, I was unconscious for three days. What should I do about the prayers? The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Pray the prayer of the day you awakened, for it is sufficient for you. Zayd said: Regarding the unconscious person, if he was unconscious for less than three days, he repeats all of them. If he was unconscious for three days or more, he repeats only the prayers with limited time windows. If he awakens before Maghrib, he repeats Zuhr and Asr. If he awakens before Fajr, he repeats Maghrib and Isha. And this is the explanation of the Prophet's ﷺ saying to Abdullah ibn Rawahah: Repeat the prayers of your day.",

He said: If you can sit him, sit him, otherwise direct him towards the Qibla and command him to gesture with indication and make his prostration lower than his ruku'. If he cannot recite the Quran, recite near him and make him hear. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The sick person prays standing. If he cannot, then sitting, and he bows and prostrates on the ground. If he cannot, then he gestures with indication. He said: He does not prostrate on a stick, nor on a fan, nor on a pillow.

      "english_translation": "Narrated from his father, from his grandfather, from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, he said: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to recite Surah Al-Sajdah (Chapter 32) in the Fajr prayer on Friday, then prostrate. He would magnify when he prostrated and when he raised his head. In the second rak'ah he recited: Has there not come upon man a period of time (Chapter 76). [Second chain:] From his father, from his grandfather, from Ali, may Allah be pleased with him: He used to pray after Friday two rak'ahs, then four, then return and rest. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The call (Adhan) on Friday is when the Imam ascends the minbar, and when he descends the Muezzin gives the Iqamah. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: The Imam speaks loudly in recitation on Friday and does not perform Qunut. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Friday prayer is only obligatory on the people of cities. Whoever is outside the city, Friday is not obligatory on him unless he hears the call, in which case it becomes obligatory. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Friday prayer is not obligatory on a slave, nor on a sick person, nor on a woman, nor on a traveler.",

Whoever wishes to attend, that is Allah's favor which He bestows upon whom He wills, and whoever leaves it, there is no sin on him. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: If you miss the Imam in the Eid prayer or Friday prayer, pray four rak'ahs. Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, said: Whoever catches the Imam bowing in Friday or Eid prayer before he bows in the second rak'ah of Eid prayer, he prays two rak'ahs. If he catches him after he raises his head from ruku', he prays four rak'ahs.",
