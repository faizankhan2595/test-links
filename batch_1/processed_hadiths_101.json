He said: This refers to when they were commanded with the Tabuk expedition after the conquest (of Makkah) and after (the battle of) Al-Ta'if and after (the battle of) Hunayn. They were commanded to march forth in the summer when the date palms were ripening, the fruit had ripened, and the shade was desirable, which made going forth difficult for them.",
