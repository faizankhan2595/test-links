(2) From al-Hajjaj ibn al-Hajjaj, from Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Qasim, from his father, from Aisha, she said: 'I used to perfume the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when he entered ihram at the time he entered ihram, and when he ended it when he threw the jamra before he visited the House.' (3) From Sufyan, from Salama ibn Kuhayl, from al-Hasan al-Urani, from Ibn Abbas, he said: Whoever throws the furthest jamra on the Day of Sacrifice, everything becomes permissible for him except women. It was said to him: What about perfume? He said: I saw the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, 'He had smeared his head with musk.' Do you see that as perfume or not? (4) From Umar ibn Sa'id, from Sulayman, from Abu al-Duha, from Masruq, from Aisha, she said: 'It is as if I am looking at the shine of perfume in the parting of the hair of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, while he is in ihram.' (5) From Ayyub ibn Abi Tamima, from al-Qasim, from Aisha, she said: 'I used to perfume the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, when he entered ihram at the time he entered ihram, and when he ended it at the time he ended it.' (6) From Musa ibn Uqba, from Nafi', from Ibn Umar, he said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, 'When he arrived at Mecca, he would stay at Dhu Tuwa and spend the night until he prayed the dawn prayer.' Ibn Umar said: The prayer place of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, at that place is on a rough hillock, not where the mosque was built, but lower than that.",
