    "english_translation": "Narrated by Ismail ibn Ibrahim who said: Laith ibn Abi Sulaim narrated to us from Mujahid from Abdullah ibn Umar that he was asked about the rock which was in Jerusalem. He said to him: Some people say... (mentioning their claim), but Allah is far above what they say in exaltation and greatness. So Abdullah ibn Umar trembled in fear and compassion when they described Him with bounds and movement. Abdullah ibn Umar said: 'Indeed Allah is greater and more magnificent to be described with the descriptions of the created things. This is the speech of the Jews, enemies of Allah. Rather they say: Al-Rahman rose over the Throne, meaning His command and power are over His creation.' Laith said: Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah said: 'May Allah fight the people of Syria, how disbelieving they are, or he said how misguided they are, saying that Allah placed His foot on the rock of Jerusalem...' and al-Hasan said: 'His mention, praise and glory rose over His creation, and Allah the Blessed and Most High is not described with movement from one place to another.' It was said Hushayim was asked about that and he said: 'Our scholars used to say: He overpowered the Throne.' And al-Hasan said regarding His saying 'Then He rose to the heaven while it was smoke': meaning His command and power and gentleness became supreme over His creation, and Allah is not described with the descriptions of the created, nor does description fall upon Him as it falls upon creation. And Abdullah ibn Masud, Aisha, Abdullah ibn Umar, Ibn al-Hanafiyyah, and Urwah ibn al-Zubayr used to reject what the people of Syria said about the rock and forbid from it and were strict about it.",

He said: You are saying a great word meaning the anthropomorphism which they mentioned. Rather it means the revelation of the severe matter. Said said in the hadith of Asim ibn Kulaib: If I knew who said this anthropomorphism I would have done to him such-and-such. And Ali ibn Asim said: It is the truth. So he was pleased with Said's statement and rejected the other's narration. And Ibn Abbas said: About the severe matter, did you not hear what the poets said: The war rose on a leg meaning on severity. And Ikrimah said: Do you not see when war becomes severe they say: The war rose on a leg. The poet said: My people are the Banu Qays, when war unfolds...

They said: He mentioned that when Allah created the heavens and the earth, He ascended to heaven from Jerusalem and placed His foot on the rock of Jerusalem. Ibn Masud gasped in disgust, then said: O Allah, there is no disbelief after faith, repeating this several times. Then he said: 'They wish that you disbelieved as they disbelieved so you might be equal.' I think this is none other than Satan manifesting in his form. Then he said: Why did you not reject him and say as the righteous servant Abraham said: 'I love not those that set.' He means the setting, the transient. So beware, the Jews upon your religion. And he said: A time will come upon people when they pray, fast, and perform pilgrimage, yet if you shot an arrow among them you would not hit except a disbeliever or hypocrite, because polytheism is more hidden than the creeping of ants on a black stone in the dark night. And that is from their denial of their Lord in their hearts where they described Him with bounds and movement.",

But if that indicated He is in the sky without the earth, then the statement of the Children of Israel to Moses would indicate that Allah is in the earth without the sky, because bringing forth from the earth is like sending down from the sky. Allah the Exalted is the Determiner of all things as He wills, some He determines from the sky and some from the earth. He is the Creator and Manager of that. The meaning of the disciples' request from the sky is because that is more evident for creation and greater for the answer and clearer for the sign, because that is something the creation cannot claim, neither sorcerer nor soothsayer. Rather, Allah by His mercy and favor manages affairs from where He wills without moving or changing.",

She said: I have heard my beloved, upon him be peace, say: Many of those who drink from my Pond will be from the people of Oman. Abu Sufyan said: It reached me that women from Syria entered upon Aisha and she asked them: Where are you from? They said: From Syria. So she said to them: Perhaps you are among those who use the bathhouses. The women were silent. Abu Sufyan said: It reached me that a wife of Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan entered upon Aisha. And Aisha placed a leather cushion under her and turned toward a part of the house, then brought a bowl of bread with broth and poured milk on it and said: Eat. Muawiyah's wife smiled and said: O Mother, we return to something softer than this, meaning fine food. Then Aisha sighed deeply and said: The Prophet of Allah died without being satisfied with bread soaked in broth. Then she said: The Prophet of Allah died without being satisfied with barley bread.",
