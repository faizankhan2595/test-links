You are the light of the heavens and the earth. All praise is for You. You are the sustainer of the heavens and the earth. All praise is for You. You are the Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is in them. You are the truth, and Your word is truth, and Your promise is truth, and meeting You is truth, and Paradise is truth, and the Fire is truth, and the Hour is truth. O Allah, to You I have submitted, in You I have believed, upon You I have relied, to You I have turned, and with You I have disputed, and to You I have referred for judgment. Forgive me what I have sent forward and what I have left behind, what I have done in secret and what I have done openly. You are my God, there is no god but You.' Also narrated from al-Rabi' from Ubadah ibn al-Samit: When the Prophet ﷺ saw the crescent moon, he would say: 'Allah is greater, Allah is greater twice. All praise is for Allah. There is no might or power except with Allah. O Allah, I ask You for the good of this month, and I seek refuge in You from its evil and from the evil of the Day of Gathering.'",

Also, it reached me from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying: Beseech your Lord and supplicate to Him during ease, for indeed Allah said: Whoever supplicates to Me during ease, I shall answer him during hardship. Whoever asks Me, I shall give him. Whoever humbles himself before Me, I shall exalt him. Whoever beseeches Me, I shall have mercy on him. Whoever seeks My forgiveness, I shall forgive him. Also narrated: Abu Ubaidah said it reached me from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ through Jabir ibn Zayd that he said: It reached me from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Our Lord, the Blessed and Most High, says when the last third of the night remains: Who will supplicate to Me so I answer him?
