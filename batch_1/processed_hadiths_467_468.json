He said: The witnesses who are present with him say: 'Fear Allah, maintain ties with them, show kindness to them, give to them. If it were they, they would not do it, nor would they love to leave something for their children.' So we went to Miksam, and he said: 'What did Said say?' We informed him, and he said: 'No, rather they say: Fear Allah, do not bequeath, keep it for your children. And if the one who bequeaths has children, they would love for him to bequeath to them.'",
