    "english_translation": "Narrated by Mujahid: Regarding his statement (in Quran 16:91) 'And do not break your oaths after making them binding' - he means: after strengthening them in swearing oaths. He says: 'And be not like the woman who unravels her spun thread after it had become strong' (16:92), meaning: she unraveled her rope after it had been made strong. 'That one nation might be greater in number than another nation' (16:92) - he means: greater and mightier. They used to make covenants with allies, then they would find more numerous and mightier ones, so they would break the covenant with these and make covenant with those who were mightier. They were prohibited from this. He says 'That one nation might be greater in number than another nation' - meaning: that one people might be more numerous than another people and mightier.",
