Concerning 'When it illuminated what was around it' (Quran 2:17), he said: As for the illumination of the fire, it is their turning towards the believers and towards guidance. As for the disappearance of their light, it is their turning towards the disbelievers and towards misguidance. The illumination of lightning and its darkness are similar to this example.",
