    "english_translation": "Narrated from Zayd ibn Aslam who said: There was a dispute between Abu Dharr and a man from the Muslims. Abu Dharr reviled him (insulted his mother) by mentioning a slave woman he had in the days of ignorance. This reached the Prophet ﷺ, who said: Indeed in you, O Abu Dharr, is a quality of (pre-Islamic) pride. Nothing makes one better than another - black or green - until your companion is pleased with you. I set out seeking him and he saw me before I saw him. He said: Peace be upon you, O Abu Dharr. I came and greeted him and said: Forgive me. He said: May Allah forgive you. Then I came to the Prophet ﷺ and mentioned that to him and informed him that he was pleased with me and had sought forgiveness for me. I said: Forgive me, O Messenger of Allah. He said: May Allah forgive your companion. Then I said: Forgive me, O Messenger of Allah. He said: May Allah forgive your companion. I said: Forgive me, O Messenger of Allah - I do not know except that in the third time he said: Allah has forgiven you.",

The lender said: I will not lend to you until you bring me a guarantor. The borrower said: I cannot find anyone to guarantee for me, but for you Allah is a guarantor and surety that I will repay you. So he lent to him. The lender then traveled by sea. When the time for repayment came, he was unable to travel to him, and the sea separated them. He took a piece of wood and drilled it, then placed the dinars in it, wrote a letter to him and placed it with the dinars. Then he sealed it. Then he said: O Allah, You took responsibility for me, and whoever pays the guarantor is absolved. Indeed, I am paying to you. He threw the wood into the sea, and the wind or the waves buffeted it back and forth. He said: If I had taken this wood for firewood for my family. So he took the wood. When he entered his house, he broke it and found the dinars and the letter, and it was from his companion. Time passed until his companion came and confronted him. He said: By Allah, indeed Allah knows that I have repaid you. He was silent towards him and went with him to count it. When he brought them out, he said: By Allah, indeed Allah knows that I have repaid you. He said: How did you repay? He informed him how he had done it. He said: Then Allah has repaid it for you.",
