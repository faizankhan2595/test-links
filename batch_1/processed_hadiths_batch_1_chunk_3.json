    "english_translation": "I asked Zayd ibn Ali: Regarding a man who says: 'On the day I marry this woman, she is divorced.' He said: I hate it but it is not forbidden. I asked him about the divorce of the one under coercion, and he said: My father narrated to me from my grandfather, from Ali: Three matters are equal in their mistake, intentionality, joking, and seriousness: divorce, emancipation, and marriage. And I asked him about divorce in Persian and Coptic, he said: Divorce in every language. And I asked him about a man who divorces in his heart without speaking it, he said: It does not occur. And I asked him about a man who says to his wife: You are divorced if Allah wills, or he says to his slave: You are free if Allah wills. He said: His wife is not divorced and his slave is not emancipated. And I asked him about a man who says to his wife: You are divorced and divorced and divorced. He said: If he has consummated the marriage with her, it is three. If he has not consummated, it is one. And if he says: You are divorced three times, it is three divorces whether he consummated or not.",
