    "english_translation": "Narrated by al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ went to answer a need during the expedition of Tabuk. Al-Mughirah said: I went with him carrying water. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came, I poured the water upon him. He washed his face, then attempted to draw his hands from the sleeves of his tunic but could not due to the narrowness of the sleeves, so he drew them from beneath the tunic and washed his hands, wiped his head, and wiped upon the khuffs (leather socks). Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came while Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf was leading them, and he had already led them in one rak'ah. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ then led them in the remaining rak'ah, at which the people became alarmed. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ finished, he said: You have done well.",

He disapproved of that, so Sa'd said to him: Ask your father when you come to him. Abdullah came and forgot to ask Umar about it until Sa'd came. He said: Did you ask your father? He said: No. So Abdullah asked him. Umar said: When you put your feet into the khuffs and they are pure from wudu, then wipe upon them. Abdullah said: Even if one of us comes from the toilet? Umar said: Yes, even if one of you comes from the toilet. And separately: Abdullah ibn Umar used to urinate in the marketplace, then perform wudu, washing his face and hands, and wiping his head. Then when he entered the mosque for a funeral prayer, he wiped upon his khuffs and prayed. Also narrated: I saw Anas ibn Malik go to Quba, urinate, then perform wudu, washing his face, his hands to the elbows, wiping his head, and wiping on the khuffs, then he came to the mosque and prayed.",
