      "english_translation": "Narrated by Hisham ibn Urwah from his father that Ali entered to a man from Banu Hashim, and he wanted to make a will while he had little wealth and he had children. So Ali said: 'Indeed Allah the Mighty and Majestic said: If he leaves wealth, the will is obligatory, and there is no excess in your wealth over your children, so he forbade him from making a will.' Regarding His statement: 'Whoever fears from the testator a deviation or sin' - He said: 'Deviation' means error, 'or sin' means intentional (wrongdoing).'",
