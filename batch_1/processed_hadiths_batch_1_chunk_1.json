    "english_translation": "Narrated from Ali: Regarding the different types of divorce - the conditional divorce (al-khiliyyah), the clear divorce (al-barriyyah), the absolute divorce (al-batilah), the decisive divorce (al-battah), and the binding divorce (al-ba'in). The forbidden matters we hold back on, so we say: 'What did you intend?' If he says: 'I intended one,' it counts as one binding divorce, and she is wholly in her own possession. If he says: 'I intended three,' it is forbidden until she marries another husband. She will not be lawful for the first husband until she enters into a marital relationship with the second, and he tastes of her union, and she tastes of his union.",
