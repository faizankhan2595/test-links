And [separate chain]: From Zayd ibn Aslam, I do not know it except as mursal: He said: Allah has not created any creation except He created what overcomes it. His mercy overcomes His anger, and charity extinguishes sin like water extinguishes fire. And Allah created the earth and it flourished and became decorated, saying: What overcomes me? So He created mountains and made them firm. The mountains said: We overcame the earth, what overcomes us? So He created iron. Iron said: We overcame the mountains, what overcomes us? So He created water. Water said: We overcame fire, what overcomes us? So He created wind. He placed it in the clouds. Wind said: We overcame water, what overcomes us? So He created man building structures that wind cannot penetrate. Man said: We overcame wind, what overcomes us? So He created death. Death said: We overcame man, what overcomes us? Allah said: I overcome you.",
