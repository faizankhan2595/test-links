And narrated from him: I went out with the Prophet ﷺ when he had purified himself for prayer. He touched his nose with his thumb and behold there was blood. He repeated it once and saw nothing, then he wiped it on the earth. He did not renew his ablution and went to prayer. It was asked to Zayd: What about one whose nosebleed does not stop? He said: He performs ablution for every prayer even if blood flows, and this should be at the end of the prayer time. It was asked to Zayd ibn Ali: What about a man who sleeps during prayer whether he is in bowing, prostration, or sitting? He said: Ablution is not broken.",
