He said: O Abdullah ibn Abbas, what is your opinion regarding a man who killed a believer intentionally? He said: His recompense is Hell, abiding therein, and Allah's anger is upon him, and He has cursed him, and has prepared for him a great punishment (referring to Quran 4:93). He said: What if he repented and believed and performed righteous deeds and then was guided aright? He said: How can he do so, may his mother be bereft of him, the guidance! By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Abdullah, I heard your Prophet ﷺ say: The mother of the one who kills a believer intentionally will be bereaved. He will come on the Day of Judgment with his head hanging by his right hand or his left hand, with his killer grasping him by his other hand. His jugular vein will gush with blood in front of the Throne of the Merciful. He will say: O Lord, ask this one about why he killed me. By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Abdullah, this verse was revealed and no verse abrogated it until your Prophet ﷺ was taken, and no proof came down after it.",

So the Prophet ﷺ looked at the faces of the people and called a man and said: I wish to marry you to this woman if you are willing. She said: I am content with what you approve for me, O Prophet ﷺ. Then he said to the man: Do you have anything? He said: No, by Allah. He said: Go to the women. So he went to them and did not find anything with them. He said: How much of the Quran do you memorize?

In it: Verily Ibrahim made Makkah sacred, and I make Madinah sacred. It is sacred between its two lava fields. No tree is cut from it except for fodder, and no weapon is carried in it for fighting. Whoever commits an innovation, it is upon him, and whoever commits an innovation or harbors an innovator, upon him is the curse of Allah, the angels, and all people together. Neither substitution nor compensation is accepted from him. The believers are equal in blood, and the lowest of them seeks protection in their covenant. They are one hand against those other than them. No believer is killed for a non-believer, and no one with a covenant is killed while in his covenant.",

They both are equal in reward. And a man to whom Allah gave wealth and he uses it in his amusements and desires and pleasures, when another sees him he says: I wish I had the same wealth to work as he does.
