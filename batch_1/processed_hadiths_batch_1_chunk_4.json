One son said: Either you nurse him and get no inheritance, or I nurse him for no inheritance. They said: Go ahead and nurse him for no inheritance. He nursed him until he died, taking nothing from his wealth. He was visited in a dream and told to go to a place and take one hundred dinars. He asked in his dream: Is there blessing in it? They said: No. He refused and told his wife, who encouraged him to take it. He refused. That evening, he dreamed again about taking ten dinars, but again was told no blessing. He refused. On the third night, he was told to take one dinar, and this time was told: Yes, there is blessing in it. He took the dinar to the market and found a man with two fish asking one dinar. He bought them. At home, when he split them, he found a pearl in each belly like none the people had seen. The king sought to buy one pearl but found it only with him. He sold it for thirty camels of gold. The king said: This needs a partner. They came to him offering double the price for the other pearl, and he gave it.",
