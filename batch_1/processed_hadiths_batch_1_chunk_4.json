If they take money but do not kill, their hands and feet are cut off alternately. If they kill and take money, their hands and feet are cut off alternately and they are crucified until they die. If they repent before being captured, they must pay the money and the legal retaliation is applied to them, but they are not subjected to the prescribed punishment.",
