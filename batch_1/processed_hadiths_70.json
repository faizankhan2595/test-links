    "english_translation": "Narrated by Mujahid: Regarding the saying of Allah 'Until there is no persecution' (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:193), he said: There is no idolatry, and 'And the religion should be for Allah only. So if they cease' (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:193), he said: Do not fight except those who fight you. Then from Abd al-Rahman: I narrated that Ibrahim said: I heard Adam say: I heard Warqa say: From Ibn Abi Najjah from Mujahid saying: 'Quraysh boasted about repelling the Messenger of Allah ﷺ while in sacred state at Hudaybiyyah away from the Sacred House in Dhu al-Qi'dah, so Allah brought him into Makkah the following year in Dhu al-Qi'dah, and he completed his Umrah - he completed it at the day of Hudaybiyyah - so Allah said: The sacred month for the sacred month, and sacred things are retaliatory (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:194)'.",
