      "english_translation": "Narrated by Yahya ibn Abi Kathir from a man of the people of Syria: I entered upon Abu Dharr while he was igniting wood beneath a pot that had been rained upon, and his tears were flowing. His wife said to him: 'You had an alternative to this, if you had wished you would have been helped.' Abu Dharr said: 'This is my livelihood, so if you are pleased then well, otherwise under the shelter of Allah.' The narrator said: 'It was as if he had placed a stone in her mouth.' When what was in the pot had cooked, he brought a bowl for himself, broke into it a thick loaf of bread of his, then he brought what was in the pot and poured it over it, then he brought it to his wife, then he said to me: 'Come near.' We ate, then he ordered his slave-girl to give us drink so she gave us a drink of some goat's milk of his. I said: 'O Abu Dharr, if you had taken something for yourself in your house.' He said: 'O slave of Allah! Do you desire for me more reckoning than this? Is there not here a mat that we spread, and a cloak that we spread, and a garment that we wear, and a cooking pot that we cook in, and a bowl that we eat from, and in which we wash our heads, and a cup that we drink from, and a skin in which there is oil or fat, and a flour container in which there is flour? Do you desire more reckoning for me than this?' I said: 'Then where is your salary of four hundred dinars? And you are in honor from the salary, so where does it go?' He said: 'I will not hide it from you. For me in this village there are thirty horses. When my salary comes out I buy fodder for them, and provisions for those who take care of them, and expenses for my family. If anything remains from it I buy with it coins and place it with a Nabatean here. If my family needs the meat of a sheep they take from it, and if they need anything they take from it. Then I ride on them in the way of Allah. This is the path of my salary. There is with Abu Dharr neither a dinar nor a dirham.'",

She said: 'We do that, but he does not leave anyone from his family nor anyone present except he calls upon him (invokes something upon him). You speak to him about this.' Ibn Mu'ti' said to him: 'O Abu Abdillah al-Rahman! If you took food that would return your body to you.' He replied: 'Indeed, eight years have passed over me in which I did not have a single full meal, or he said: I did not have except one meal in them.
