If you do not do this, then to whom do you turn them over - to the Jews or to the Christians?'

He pronounced four takbirs over it, then came and sat at the edge of the grave. Then he ordered the bier and it was placed near the feet of the grave. Then he ordered it to be withdrawn, and then the Prophet ﷺ said: 'Place him in his grave on his right side facing the qiblah, and say: In the Name of Allah and by Allah and in the Way of Allah and on the religion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Do not throw him on his face, nor throw him on his back. Then say: O Allah, teach him his testimony, elevate his spirit, and grant him Your pleasure.' When the soil was cast upon him, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood and scattered three handfuls into his grave. Then he ordered his grave to be squared and water was sprinkled on it from a waterskin. Then he supplicated with what Allah willed for him to supplicate, then he said: 'O Allah, let the earth be gentle upon his side, elevate his spirit, and grant him Your pleasure.' When we finished burying him, a man came to him and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, I did not catch the prayer over him. Should I pray over his grave?' He said: 'No, but stand at his grave and supplicate for your brother and show mercy upon him and seek forgiveness for him.'",
