He found a well and descended into it, drank, and came out. Behold, there was a dog panting and eating the earth out of thirst. The man said: This dog has reached the same degree of thirst that I reached. So he descended into the well, filled his shoe with water, held it in his mouth, ascended, and gave the dog to drink. Allah appreciated that and forgave him. The people said: O Messenger of Allah, is there for us a reward for (our kindness to) animals? He said: In every living creature is a reward.",
