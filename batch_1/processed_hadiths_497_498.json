By what did you give them that? He said: Abraham did not consider anything equal to Me except that he chose Me over it. And Isaac was generous to Me with himself, so he is more generous than others. As for Jacob, I did not test him with any trial except that he increased in good faith in Me. Regarding His statement 'And with them will be those of limited gaze, of same age' (Surah Sad, verse 52), he said: Their sight became limited to their spouses, so they desired none other.",
