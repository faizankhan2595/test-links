When the messengers came to Lot, the people of his town followed them, and they were beautiful, but they did not say anything to them. When they entered upon Lot and saw his displeasure at them and the fear that had entered him from them, they said: We are messengers of your Lord, they will not reach you. When they came near, they took earth and threw it at them and put out their eyes. That is His saying: We blinded their eyes. They returned to their companions saying: We are bewitched, bewitched. Lot said to the messengers: Now, now! Meaning their destruction. They said: Surely their appointed time is the morning. Then Ibn Abbas said: There are three letters in the Quran which are not preserved. Do you not see that it is the saying of Allah: Is not the morning near? And the other two letters. Then he followed it: Indeed the kings when they enter a city destroy it and make the mighty of its people weak. Allah said: And thus they do. And the saying to Joseph: That I may know that I have not betrayed him in the unseen and that Allah does not guide the deception of the treacherous. A guardian of the guardians said to him: Nor when you intended? He said: I acquit not my soul. So he returned. So Gabriel raised the city with his wing and crushed it and whatever was in it, until the people of the lowest heaven heard their voices, then he overturned it, then he pursued those who fled among them with stones. In His saying: Of baked clay. He said: In it is clay.",
