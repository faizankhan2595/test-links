He said: 'A man who was from Thamud, he was in the sanctuary of Allah, so the sanctuary of Allah prevented the punishment of Allah from reaching him.

One day he said to his son: 'I am troubled, if only you would bring some men to talk to me.' So his son gathered a group of men and said: 'Enter and speak with him. If you hear something reprehensible from him, forgive him, for he is old. If you hear something good from him, accept it.' They entered and the first thing he said was: 'Is not the most clever of the clever the one who has piety? And verily the most foolish of the foolish is the one who commits immorality. When one of you marries, let him marry from a good family. And when you perceive from a man a vice, beware of it, for it has companions.'",

Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf was away working in his land at al-Jurf. The man went to him and found him with his cloak off, a hoe in his hand, directing water in his land. When Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf saw him, he removed the hoe from his hand and put on his cloak. The man said: 'I came for one reason but saw something more amazing than it. What is it that we are quick in jihad and you are slow in it? We abstain from the world while you desire it? Yet you are our predecessors and the companions of our Prophet!' Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf said: 'We do not know except what you know, nor has come to us except what came to you. But we were tested with hardship and we were patient, and we were tested with ease yet we were not patient.'",
