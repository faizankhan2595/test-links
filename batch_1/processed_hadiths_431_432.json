I was informed of a gathering that Nawf was leading, so I came to him. Behold, there was a man with spoiled eyes wearing a cloak. He was Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-As. When Nawf saw him, he stopped narrating. Abdullah said to him: Narrate what you were narrating. Nawf said: You are more deserving of narrating than me, you are a companion of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Abdullah said: These rulers have prevented us from narrating, meaning the governors. He said: I adjure you to narrate to us a hadith you heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying: There will be migrations after migrations for the best of people to the migration place of Abraham. None will remain in the earth except the worst of its people. Their earth will reject them, Allah's self will hate them, the fire will gather them with the apes and pigs. It will sleep with them when they sleep, it will rest with them when they rest, and it will consume those who fall behind.",

When he finished, he stood on the pulpit, mentioned the Hour, and mentioned that great matters were before him. Then he said: Whoever wishes to ask about something, let him ask. By Allah, you will not ask me about anything except I will narrate it to you as long as I am in this position. Anas said: The people wept abundantly when they heard this from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and the Messenger of Allah ﷺ repeatedly said: Ask me, ask me. A man stood up and said: Where is his dwelling, O Messenger of Allah? He said: The Fire. Abdullah ibn Hudhafah also stood up and said: Who is my father, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Your father is Hudhafah. Then he kept saying: Ask me. Umar fell on his knees and said: We are pleased with Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion, and Muhammad ﷺ as our Messenger. The Prophet ﷺ fell silent when Umar said that, then the Prophet ﷺ said: By Him in Whose Hand is my soul, I was shown Paradise and the Fire just now beside this wall while I was praying, and I have not seen such good and evil as today.",
