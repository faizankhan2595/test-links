He said: Let her look at the number of nights and days during which she used to menstruate in the month before this affliction befell her. Let her refrain from prayer for that duration of the month. Then when that has passed, let her perform ghusl, then let her cover herself with a cloth, then let her pray. Additionally, narrated: It was seen that Zaynab bint Jahsh, who was under Abdur-Rahman ibn Awf, had istihadah, and she used to bathe and pray.",
