The Prophet ﷺ said: 'Curse the Satan, this is a strike from Satan in your womb, so do not abandon prayer for it.' She said: 'How should I do, O Messenger of Allah?' He ﷺ said: 'Sit during the days of menstruation that you used to menstruate every month, then do not pray in them nor fast, nor enter the mosque, nor recite the Quran, and when those days pass and you sit (thinking) you menstruate, make it the maximum of your menstruation days, then bathe for dawn prayer, then insert cotton and use a feminine girdle like a man does, then pray the dawn prayer, then delay the noon prayer until the end of its time and bathe and insert cotton and use a feminine girdle like a man, then pray the noon prayer when the time of afternoon prayer has entered, and pray the afternoon prayer, then delay the sunset prayer until the end of its time, then bathe and insert cotton and use a feminine girdle, then pray the sunset prayer when the time of night prayer has entered, then pray the night prayer.' She turned away crying and saying: 'O Messenger of Allah, I cannot do this.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ showed compassion to her and said: 'Bathe for every period of purity as you used to do, and make it like a wound in your body - whenever blood flows, then purify yourself, and do not abandon the cotton and the feminine girdle, and if that extends for her, then let her enter the mosque and recite the Quran and pray and perform the rituals.'",

They said: No, rather with permission. He said: If it were otherwise, I would punish you. Woe to you, are you sorcerers? You have asked me about things which no one has asked me since I asked the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about them. Were you not present, O Abu al-Hasan? He (Ali) said: Yes. He said: Tell them what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ answered me for you remember it better than I do. He (Ali) said: I asked him about bathing from sexual impurity. He ﷺ said: Pour water on your hands before putting them in your vessel, then strike your hands to your elbows and clean the water, then strike your hands on the ground, then pour water from it, then rinse your mouth and sniff water three times, then wash your face and forearms three times each, and wipe your head and wash your feet, then pour water on your head three times, pour water on both your sides and rub your body with whatever your hands reach.",

Zayd ibn Ali said: It is not permissible to have sexual intercourse with the menstruating woman until she bathes, because of His saying (Exalted is He): 'Abstain from women during menstruation and do not approach them until they purify themselves. When they have purified themselves, come to them from where Allah has ordered you.' He said (may Allah be pleased with him): From the front (vagina).

He said: Because you embellish your call to prayer (sing it melodiously meaning you make it pleasant), and you take a fee for teaching the Quran. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: Whoever takes a fee for teaching the Quran, his reward on the Day of Judgment will be (his fate). Zayd ibn Ali said: The call to prayer is (obligatory) in the five prayers and on Friday, and there is no call to prayer and no call to begin prayer on the two Eids, nor is there a call to prayer and a call to begin prayer in the evening prayer. Zayd ibn Ali said: When you are traveling, give the call to prayer for the dawn prayer and give the call to begin prayer for the remaining prayers. Zayd ibn Ali said: The call to prayer of a child and of a woman for men is not valid. Zayd ibn Ali said: When you are settled (not traveling), their call to prayer suffices you, but if you give it yourself it is better.",
