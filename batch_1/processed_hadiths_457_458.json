Regarding His saying: \"And an admonition for the pious\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:66), it is said: For the Ummah of Muhammad ﷺ. Regarding His saying, Mighty and Majestic: \"Neither worn-out nor virgin, of an age between those two\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:68), said: Worn-out is mature, virgin is young, and of an age between is she who has given birth once or twice. He said: Between those two. Regarding His saying: \"A yellow cow, bright in color\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:69), radiant, exceedingly yellow. Regarding His saying: \"Without any blemish on it\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:71), it is said: There is no color or mark on it. Regarding His saying: \"Whoever commits an evil deed\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:81), it is said: Associating partners with Allah. \"And his sin has encircled him\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:81), it is said: Every deed that has made the Fire obligatory upon him. The companions of Abdullah used to recite it: \"And speak to the people kindly.\" Regarding His saying: \"You will surely find them clinging most greedily to life\" (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:96), it is said: The Jews.",
