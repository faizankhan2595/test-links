As for the one for whom they are a source of reward, it is a man who ties them in the way of Allah and gives them long rope in a pasture or garden. Whatever they consume in that pasture or garden is recorded as good deeds for him. Even if the rope breaks and they run up to a hill or two, their footprints and droppings are recorded as good deeds for him. If they pass by a river and drink from it without him intending that, it is recorded as good deeds for him. Such horses are a source of reward. And a man who ties them for self-sufficiency and dignity, but does not forget Allah's right over their necks and backs - such horses are a covering for him. And a man who ties them out of pride and showing off and to demonstrate hostility towards the Muslims - such horses are a burden upon him.' Al-Rabi' explained: 'Giving them long rope' means when he ties them with a rope in a pasture and extends the rope so they can graze. 'They ran up' means they galloped. 'Did not forget Allah's right' means he did not abandon Allah's right. 'Demonstrating hostility towards the Muslims' means enmity towards the Muslims.",

I saw a man from the polytheists overpowering a man from the Muslims. I went around to get behind him and struck him with my sword on the neck vein until I cut through the armor. He then turned toward me and embraced me with such force that I felt the smell of death, then death overtook him and he released me. I then went and heard the Prophet ﷺ saying: 'Whoever kills an enemy and has evidence for it, then the spoils are his.' I stood up and said: Who will testify for me? I sat down. Then the Prophet ﷺ said the same thing again, and I stood up saying: Who will testify for me? Then he said it a third time, and I stood up. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'What is wrong with you, Abu Qatadah?' I related the incident to him. A man from the people said: You are truthful, O Messenger of Allah, and his spoils are with me, so compensate him from it. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq said: No, by Allah! He will not go to one of Allah's lions who fights in the cause of Allah and His Messenger only for you to give him his spoils. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'He is truthful, so give them to him.' Abu Qatadah said: So he gave them to me, and I sold the armor and bought a palm garden (kharraf) in Bani Salamah, and it was the first wealth I acquired in Islam. Al-Rabi' explained: Al-kharraf means a grove of date palms, and I acquired it means I earned it.",

And it is narrated: From Ubadah ibn al-Samit who said: The Prophet ﷺ led us in prayer, and a camel from the spoils passed by us.
