Know that Allah has assigned seven angels to every rebellious Satan so he is not free until the month of Ramadan ends, and the gates of the heaven are opened from the first night of it to the last night for the time of supplication in it being accepted.' Then when the first night of the last ten came, he rolled up his sleeves and fastened his lower garment and exited from his house and stayed in seclusion for the last ten nights, spending the nights in worship. He would bathe between the two evening prayers, may the blessings of Allah and peace be upon him. He said: I asked the Imam Abu al-Husayn Zayd ibn Ali, may Allah be pleased with him: What is the meaning of 'fastened his lower garment'? He said: He would separate from women during them.",

I dislike kissing for the young but allow it for the elderly. Cupping and kohl do not break the fast, but I dislike cupping fearing weakness. The fasting person should not use a wet miswak and should not wet his miswak, using it between now and midday. I asked about a fly entering the throat of a fasting person, and it was said it does not break the fast. Regarding rinsing the mouth where water enters the throat: if within three times it does not break the fast, but if after three times it does break the fast. Nasal drops and enemas break the fasting. Regarding the traveler breaking the fast during travel: the traveler breaks the fast during a journey of three days or more. If he intends to stay ten days he must fast.",

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to her: 'Go and break your fast. When you are able, fast.' A nursing woman came to him and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, this is the month of Ramadan ordained, and I fear that if I fast my milk will stop and my child will perish.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to her: 'Go and break your fast. When you are able, fast.' A man suffering from thirst came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, this is the month of Ramadan ordained and I cannot endure without water for an hour and I fear for myself if I fast.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'Go and break your fast. When you are able, fast.' An elderly man leaning on two people came and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, this is the month of Ramadan ordained and I cannot bear fasting.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'Go and feed poor people half a measure for each day.'",
