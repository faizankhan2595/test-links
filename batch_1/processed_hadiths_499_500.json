They spoke among themselves, and one of them asked: Do you think Allah hears what we say? One said: He hears when we speak loudly and does not hear when we speak softly. The other said: If He hears part of it, He hears all of it. So I came to the Prophet ﷺ and informed him, and this verse was revealed: 'And you could not hide yourselves, lest your hearing and your sight testify against you' (Quran 41:22) till the end of the verse.",
