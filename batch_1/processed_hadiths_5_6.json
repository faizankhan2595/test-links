So if one of you sees something he dislikes, let him spit to his left three times when he wakes up and seek refuge with Allah from its harm, for indeed it will not harm him if Allah wills.' He said: One of them said: 'I used to find the dreams very heavy upon me like a mountain, but when I heard this hadith, I no longer cared about them.'",

When he came near, he was asking about Islam. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him: 'Five prayers during the day and night.' He said: 'Are there others?' He said: 'No, except if you do voluntary prayers.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him: 'And fasting the month of Ramadan.' He said: 'Are there others besides it?' He said: 'No, except if you do voluntary fasting.' Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'And Zakat.' He said: 'Are there others besides it?' He said: 'No, except if you do voluntary alms.'

He said: 'Some of my slaves became believers and some became disbelievers. As for those who said: We have been rained upon by the favor of Allah and His mercy, those are believers in Me and disbelievers in the stars. But those who said: We have been rained upon by such and such star, those are disbelievers in Me and believers in the stars.' And from another chain: Abu Ubaydah reported it reached him from the Prophet ﷺ: 'Zayd ibn Amr was the first to blame me for the worship of idols and sacrificing to them...'
