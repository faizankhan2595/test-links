He said: Each group of jinn had a seat in the heavens from which they would listen. When revelation was sent down, it was heard like the sound of a chain being dragged upon the ground. There was no descent of revelation upon the people of heaven except that they were struck unconscious. When the fear was removed from their hearts, they said: What did your Lord say? They said: The Truth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. Then He would say: The year will be thus and thus, and the jinn would hear it and inform the soothsayers, and the soothsayers would inform people about it, and it would come to pass as they said. When Allah sent Muhammad ﷺ, they were repelled. The Arabs said, when the jinn did not inform them about that: Someone in heaven has died. So the owner of camels began to sacrifice a camel every day for the jinn, and the owner of cattle began to sacrifice a cow every day, and the owner of sheep sacrificed a sheep, until they hastened (to spend) their wealth. Then Thaqif, and they were the wisest of the Arabs, said: O people, hold onto your wealth, for nobody in heaven has died, and this is not a scattering. Do you not see your landmarks in the stars as they are, and the sun and the moon and the night and day? Then Iblis said: A new event has occurred on earth today. Bring me some dust from every land. They brought it to him and he smelled it. When he smelled the dust of Makkah, he said: From here came the event. They looked and found that the Messenger of Allah had been sent.",
