Whoever memorized it memorized it, and whoever forgot it forgot it. And of what he said was: O people, the worldly life is green and sweet, and Allah will make you successors in it, so He will see how you act. Beware of the worldly life and beware of women. Beware, for every traitor will have a banner on the Day of Judgment by the measure of his betrayal, hoisted at his back, and no traitor has a greater banner than a leader of the public.",

When Sa'id saw that Umar was serious and would not leave him, he gave him advice saying: Fear Allah, O Umar! Establish your face and your judgment for those who entrusted you from close and distant Muslims. Love for people what you love for yourself and your family, and hate for them what you hate for yourself and your family. Do not judge with two judgments in one matter, so your opinion becomes confused and you deviate from truth. Wade into difficult matters for the sake of truth and do not fear any blame in the way of Allah. Umar said: Who can bear that, O Sa'id?

He said: The day became long for me, so I remembered whom to speak with. He narrated to me from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and I narrated to him. Then he began narrating to me, saying: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: There will be a tribulation. The sleeping in it is better than the reclining, the reclining better than the sitting, the sitting better than the standing, the standing better than the walking, the walking better than the riding, and the riding better than the running. All those killed in it are in the Fire. I said: O Messenger of Allah, when will that be? He said: In the days of chaos (harj). I said: And when are the days of chaos? He said: When a man does not trust his companion. I said: O Messenger of Allah, what do you command me if I reach that time? He said: Guard yourself and your hand and enter your house. I said: O Messenger of Allah, what if a man enters my house? He said: Enter your house. I said: O Messenger of Allah, what if a man enters my house? He said: Enter your mosque and do this, and he placed his right hand on his left wrist, and say: My Lord is Allah, until you die on that.",
