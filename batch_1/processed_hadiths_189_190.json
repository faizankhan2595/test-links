Jabir said: I heard the Prophet ﷺ say: I stayed in seclusion in Hira. When I finished my seclusion, I came down in the valley. A caller called to me from my right, left, behind and front, but I saw nothing. I looked above and behold Gabriel was sitting on a throne between heaven and earth. I hurried away from him and went to Khadijah. I said: Wrap me, wrap me. They wrapped me and poured cold water on me. Then this was revealed: 'O you wrapped in garments, arise and warn.'",
