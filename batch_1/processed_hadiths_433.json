      "english_translation": "Narrated by Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-Aas: There will be a king over the Romans who will not be disobeyed or will not be nearly disobeyed. He will come until he descends in such and such land. Abdullah said: I have not forgotten it. He said: The believers will support one another until the people of Aden bring them supplies on their camels. Abdullah said: This is written in the Book. They will fight for ten days with nothing separating them except the night. You will have no food except what is in your waterskins. Their swords will not be dulled and God will bless them and not their women. And you likewise. Then their king will command the ships and they will turn away, meaning the Roman king. He then said: Whoever wants to flee now may do so. But God will give them the upper hand and they will be killed in a slaughter such as has never been seen or will not be seen. Even the birds will pass by them and fall dead from their stench. The martyr on that day will have a double reward compared to those who died before him, and the believer on that day will have a double reward compared to those who died before him. And their remnants will never be shaken by anything, and their remnants will fight against the Dajjal.",

Ibn Sayyad looked at him and said: I testify that you are the Messenger of the unlettered people. Ibn Sayyad said to the Prophet ﷺ: Do you testify that I am the Messenger of Allah? The Prophet ﷺ said: I believe in Allah and His Messenger. The Prophet ﷺ asked him: What comes to you? Ibn Sayyad replied: Truthful and lying ones come to me. The Prophet ﷺ said: Your matter has been confused for you. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: I have hidden for you something hidden, and he hid for him the smoke as mentioned in Surah Ad-Dukhan verse 10. Ibn Sayyad said: It is smoke (dukh). The Prophet ﷺ said: Lose! You shall not exceed your measure. Umar said: O Messenger of Allah, permit me to strike his neck.

He said: Before him there will be three years: one year in which the heaven will withhold a third of its rain and the earth will withhold a third of its vegetation, the second year in which the heaven will withhold two thirds of its rain and the earth will withhold two thirds of its vegetation, and the third year in which the heaven will withhold all its rain and the earth will withhold all its vegetation, so not a single hoofed animal or fanged animal will remain but will die. Among the most severe trials for the people is that the Dajjal will come to a Bedouin and say: If I revive your camels for you, do you not know that I am your Lord? He says: Yes. Then Satan will appear to him in the form of his camels with the finest udders and greatest humps. And he will come to a man whose brother and father have died and say: If I revive your father and brother for you, do you not know that I am your Lord? He says: Yes. Then Satan will appear to him in the form of his father and brother. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ went out for a need and then came back. The people were in anxiety and sorrow from what he had told them. He held both sides of the door and said: Why, O Asma? She said: O Messenger of Allah, you have torn our hearts by mentioning the Dajjal. He said: If he comes out while I am alive, I am his adversary. Otherwise my Lord is my successor over every believer. Asma said: So I said: O Messenger of Allah, by Allah, we knead our dough and cannot bake it until we become hungry. How will the believers be at that time? He said: They will be sufficed by what suffices the people of heaven from glorification and sanctification.",
