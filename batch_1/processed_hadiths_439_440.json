They said to her: Say to him: Your wives have gathered together and are invoking you for justice regarding the daughter of Abu Quhafah. She said: I entered upon the Prophet ﷺ while he was with Aisha in her wrapper. I said to him: Your wives sent me to you and they are invoking you for justice regarding the daughter of Abu Quhafah. The Prophet ﷺ said to her: Do you love me? She said: Yes. He said: Then love her. Then I returned to them and informed them what the Prophet ﷺ said. They said: You have not done anything. Go back to him. Fatimah said: By Allah, I will never return to him about this again. Al-Zuhri said: And she was truly the daughter of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. They sent Zaynab bint Jahsh. Aisha said: And she was the one who rivaled me among the wives of the Prophet ﷺ. She came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: Your wives sent me to you and they are invoking you for justice regarding the daughter of Abu Quhafah. Then she turned upon me and cursed me. Then I began to watch the Prophet ﷺ and look towards him, whether he would permit me to defend myself from her. Then he remained silent, so she cursed me until I thought he did not hate me defending myself from her. So I confronted her and quickly silenced her. The Prophet ﷺ said to her: She is the daughter of Abu Bakr. Aisha said: I have not seen a woman better, more charitable, and more maintaining of family ties, and more giving of herself in everything seeking nearness to Allah than Zaynab, except for a moment of pride from jealousy that passes from her.",
