Allah said: \"Know that from the spoils of war, a fifth belongs to Allah and the Messenger and to kindred.\" And I have been helped with terror for a month's journey, and I have been favored over the prophets on the Day of Resurrection with three things: My ummah will come on the Day of Resurrection with faces gleaming and bodies marked with ablution, known among nations, and the muezzins will come on the Day of Resurrection with the longest necks, calling with the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and messenger. And the third: There is no prophet except that he will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection for a sin, but not me, due to His saying: \"So Allah may forgive you for what has passed of your sins and what is to come.\"'",
