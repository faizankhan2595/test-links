I divorced her and she did not menstruate, so she counted her waiting period by months, believing herself to be from those who have ceased menstruation. She then married another man and stayed with him for thirty months, then she menstruated. He summoned them both and asked them about this. She informed him that she counted her waiting period by months without menstruation. He said to the second man: There is nothing between you and her, and she is entitled to her mahr from this latter one. And he said to the first: She is your wife and do not approach her until her waiting period from the latter one is completed. She asked: By what should I count, O Commander of the Believers? He said: By menstruation. The woman died before her waiting period ended, so the first husband inherited her, and the latter husband did not inherit her.",
