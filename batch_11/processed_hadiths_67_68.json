Then Umar passed by me, and I jumped up. Suddenly I found myself behind Umar on his mount. He asked: 'Who is the man?' I said: 'A man from Dabbah.' He said: 'You are rough.' I said: 'Upon the enemy, O Commander of the Believers.' He said: 'And upon the righteous.' Then he said: 'What is your need?' I said: So he fulfilled my need, then he said: 'Clear the back of our mount for us.'",

He heard from Ma'adh ibn Jabal in Yemen before he emigrated during the lifetime of the Prophet ﷺ. He was devoted to Ali ibn Abi Talib, and he was nicknamed al-Qarad (the tick) because of his devoted following of Ali. He also narrated from Salman, Ibn Umar, Ibn al-Zubayr, and Shuraih. Narrated by al-Fadl ibn Dukayn, who said: Yunus ibn Abi Ishaq narrated to us, saying: I saw Said ibn Wahb descending from his upper chamber on Friday when his son came, not attending Friday prayer, and he was the leader (arif) of his people.",
