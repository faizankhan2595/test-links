    "english_translation": "Muhammad ibn Umar informed us. He said: Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Shurahbil al-Abdari narrated to us, from Musab ibn Muhammad ibn Shurahbil meaning ibn Hasanah. He said: Utbah ibn Ghazwan had attended with Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas when the non-Arabs were defeated. Then Umar ibn al-Khattab wrote to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas: 'That he should establish his headquarters at Kufa, and that he send Utbah ibn Ghazwan to the land of India, for he has a rank in Islam, and witnessed Badr, and I hope his reward will be for the Muslims. And Basra was called at that time the land of India. So he should settle it, and take it as a headquarters for the Muslims, and not let there be a sea between me and them.' So Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas called upon Utbah ibn Ghazwan and informed him of the letter of Umar, and he agreed, and departed from Kufa with eight hundred men. They journeyed until they settled in Basra. Basra was indeed named Basra because there were black stones in it. When Utbah ibn Ghazwan settled it, he established his headquarters and settled it, and the Muslims pitched their tents and camps. Utbah ibn Ghazwan pitched a tent for himself from garments. Then Umar ibn al-Khattab sent men, and when they became many, a group among them built seven fortified quarters from mud brick in it. In al-Khurayba were two, in al-Zabuqa was one, in Bani Tamim were two, in al-Azd were two. Then Utbah went forth to the Furat of Basra and conquered it, then returned to Basra. The people of Basra used to raid the mountains of Persia neighboring them. Then a letter from Umar ibn al-Khattab came to Utbah ibn Ghazwan that: settle it with the Muslims, so they may be there, and let them raid their enemy from near.",

    "english_translation": "Utbah preached to the people, and it was the first sermon he delivered in Basra. He said: 'All praise is due to Allah, I praise Him and seek His assistance, I believe in Him and rely upon Him, I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. As for what follows: O people, verily this world has departed with haste and has announced farewell to its inhabitants. Nothing remains of it except a remnant like the remainder in a vessel. Indeed, you will inevitably leave it, so leave it with the best you have at hand. Verily, it is a marvel that a mighty stone is cast from the brink of Hell and falls for seventy years until it reaches its bottom, by Allah it will be filled. And verily, it is a marvel that Paradise has seven gates, the width between the sides of one gate is a journey of fifty years. By Allah, there shall come upon them a time when it is so crowded with throngs. And I have seen myself with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ as seventh of seven people, we had no food except the leaves of al-Bishaam and the thorns of al-Qatad until our mouths became sore from them. And I once picked up a garment and split it between myself and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas. And I have seen us afterward, we seven of the group, none of us except that he became an emir over a region of the regions. And indeed, there was no prophethood except that kingship succeeded it. So I seek refuge with Allah that that time should come to us in which the ruler becomes a king. And I seek refuge with Allah that I should be great in my own estimation and small in the estimation of people. You shall try the emirs after us and will try them, so you will know and deny.' So while Utbah was in his sermon, a man from Thaqif approached with a letter from Umar to Utbah ibn Ghazwan in which it said: As for what follows: Abu Abdullah al-Thaqafi mentioned to me that he had acquired horses in Basra when no one else was acquiring them. So when this letter of mine reaches you, treat Abu Abdullah well and help him in what he has asked your assistance for. Abu Abdullah was the first to tether a horse in Basra and took it for himself. Then it said: Utbah marched to Maysan and Ubziqabad and conquered them. The Marzuban, lord of the fortresses, came out against him with a large force and fought them. Allah defeated the Marzuban. The Marzuban sought reconciliation, so he struck his neck and took his robe and belt in which were gold and jewels. He sent that to Umar ibn al-Khattab. When the spoils of the Marzuban reached Medina, the people asked the messenger about the condition of the people. The arriving messenger said: O gathering of Muslims, why do you ask? By Allah, I left the people gathering gold and silver. The people became eager. Umar then began to send men to him in groups of one hundred and fifty and the like as reinforcement to Utbah in Basra.",

When Utbah pressed Umar, he said: What is against you, O Utbah, that you acknowledge the authority of a man from Quraysh who has companionship with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and nobility? Utbah said to him: Am I not from Quraysh? The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: The ally of the people is from them. And I have ancient companionship with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ that is not denied and not disputed. Umar said: That virtue of yours is not denied. Utbah said: Now that the matter has come to this, by Allah I will not return to it ever. Umar insisted on returning him to it, and he returned. But Utbah died on the way. His rule over Basra lasted six months. A stomach illness afflicted him and he died at the mine of Bani Sulaim. Suwaid, his slave, brought his possessions and inheritance to Umar ibn al-Khattab. This was in the year seventeen of the Hijra. Utbah ibn Ghazwan was fifty-seven years old when he died.",

When Basra was conquered and settled, he moved to it and marked out a plot for himself and built a house there.
