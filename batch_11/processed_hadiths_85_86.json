Weakness was mentioned to him, so he spread out a mat where he could see him. Amr came and stood to pray, reciting until he reached this verse 'And warn them of the Day of Approaching [the Hour]' at Qur'an 40:18. He wept until he stopped. He sat, then stood. He returned and recited 'And warn them of the Day of Approaching [the Hour]'. He wept until he stopped. He did this until morning. Then Utbah said: This is the action that works, O my son, the action. Muhammad ibn Sa'd said: In other than this hadith, Amr ibn Utbah and Mi'dad ibn Yazid al-Ijli built a mosque at the outskirts of Kufa, and Ibn Mas'ud came to them and said: I have come to break this mosque of corruption.",
