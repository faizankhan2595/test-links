So examine (my case), if the truth is with me I will dispute with them, and if the truth is not with me I will not dispute.' He recounted his story to him, so he said, 'Go and dispute with them.' So he went and disputed with them, and he judged against his son. Then he said to him when he returned to his family, 'By Allah, if I had not given you this instruction, I would not have blamed you; you have disgraced me.' He said, 'O my son, by Allah you are more beloved to me than the fill of the earth with ones like them, but Allah is more mighty upon me than you. I feared that I would inform you that the judgment was against you, so you would settle with them and lose some of their right.'",

My son came to you with his mother, and both of us would ransom him. She married so bring her, and let not haughtiness take hold of you. If you had been a widow, you would not have disputed with me over him. O Judge, this is my case regarding him.' Then the mother said: 'O Judge, the grandmother said to you. Listen to my words and do not reject me. I sacrifice my soul for my son, and my liver carried his liver. When he was in my arms as a lost orphan alone, I married hoping for good, for one who would suffice me his loss, one who would show me affection, and one who would take care to provide for me.' So Shurayh said: 'The judge has understood what both of you said, and has judged between you, then let it be final. With a clear judgment between you, and upon the judge is the effort to understand. He said to the grandmother: Take away the boy from the relatives and take your son. Had she been patient, it would have been for her, before her claim, that she would seek the substitute.'",
