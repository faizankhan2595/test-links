Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came out to them. Hamdan said to me: 'O Amer ibn Shahr, you have been a companion of kings since you were young. Will you not come to this man and scout for us? If you approve of something for us, we will approve it, and if you disapprove of something for us, we will disapprove it.' I said: 'Yes.' So I came until I arrived at the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in Madinah. I sat with him. A group came to him and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, advise us.' He said: 'I advise you with fear of Allah, and that you listen to the speech of Quraysh and abandon their actions.' I was satisfied with that and his words. Then I decided not to return to my people until I passed by the Negus, who was a friend. I passed by him. While I was sitting with him, his young son passed by him and he asked him to read a tablet with him. The boy read it. I laughed. The Negus said: 'Why did you laugh?' I said: 'Because of what this boy read before.' He said: 'By Allah, this is from what was revealed on the tongue of Jesus son of Mary. The curse will be in the earth when its rulers are children.' I returned having heard this statement from the Prophet ﷺ and this from the Negus, and my people became Muslim and descended to the plains.",
