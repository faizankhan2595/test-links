His migration was to Homs, but Umar ibn al-Khattab transferred him to Kufa and wrote to the people of Kufa: I am sending you Abdullah ibn Mas'ud as a teacher and advisor, and I prefer you with him over myself, so learn from him. He came to Kufa and settled there, built a house in it next to the mosque. Then he came to Madinah during the caliphate of Uthman ibn Affan and died there. He was buried in al-Baqi' in the year thirty-two, and he was about sixty-six years old. We have written his account among those who witnessed Badr.",
