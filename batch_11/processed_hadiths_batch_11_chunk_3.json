I said: O Muhammad, I have come to you with the son of al-Qarha' for you to use. He said: I have no need for it. Then he said: O Dhu al-Jawshan, will you not accept Islam and be among the first of this matter? He said: No. He said: Then I said: I saw your people were obsessed with you. He said: How did you hear about their deaths at Badr? I said: It reached me. He said: Then I promise you this if you conquer the Ka'bah and its covering. He said: Perhaps if you live you will see that. Then he said: O Bilal, take the man's pack, provision him from the date paste. He said: When I turned away, he said: Indeed, he is the best horseman of Bani Amir. He said: By Allah, I was with my family at al-'Ud when a rider came to us. I said: What do the people do? He said: By Allah, Muhammad has conquered the Ka'bah and its covering. He said: I said: May my mother grieve for me, and had I converted that day, then asked him for al-Hira, he would have given it to me",
