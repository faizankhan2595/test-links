When Suwayd came, al-Hajjaj asked: 'What made you call the Adhan at noon?' Suwayd replied: 'I did it with Abu Bakr and Umar.' Then al-Hajjaj said: 'Do not call the Adhan for your people, nor lead them in prayer.' Al-Hajjaj commanded them to remove him from calling the Adhan and leading prayer. Also it is mentioned that Suwayd ibn Ghafalah was hiding during the time of al-Hajjaj, and people used to pray the Zuhr on Friday in congregation. Additionally, Suwayd ibn Ghafalah used to pass by us in the mosque to his wife from Bani Asad, and he was one hundred twenty-seven years old, sometimes he would bow and sometimes he would not. Also, Suwayd ibn Ghafalah shrouded al-Ubayriq ibn Malik in two garments.",

It is mentioned that al-Aswad used to fast perpetually. Also, al-Aswad used to fast even on intensely hot days when even strong red camels would stagger from the heat. Additionally, al-Aswad would fast during journeys until his tongue would turn black from the heat, while his companions would drink several times before finishing their journey on non-Ramadan days.",

Also: al-Aswad would stop his camel when prayer time came, even if on a stone. Moreover: al-Aswad circumambulated the Kaaba eighty times between Hajj and Umrah. Al-Aswad would enter the state of ihram from his house, while Alqamah would enjoy his garments. Both Fadl ibn Dukain and Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Asadi narrated: Sufyan narrated from Mansur from Ibrahim that al-Aswad would enter ihram from his house while Alqamah would benefit from his clothes. Also: I saw al-Aswad and Amr ibn Maymun entering ihram from Kufa. Furthermore, al-Aswad would leave Kufa in the state of ihram with matted hair.
