We passed by a water called al-Rukhakh, and they told us: There is here a man who has seen the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. So we came to an old man and asked him: Did you see the Messenger of Allah ﷺ? He said: Yes, and he wrote for me about this water. He brought out a skin upon which was written the letter of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. We asked: What is your name? He said: al-Adda' ibn Khalid. We asked: What did you hear from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ? He said: I was under his she-camel on the day of Arafat while she was chewing her cud. He said: 'O people, what day is this? What month is this? What land is this?' We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: 'Is this not a sacred month, a sacred land, and a sacred day?' We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He said: 'Indeed, your blood, your wealth, and your honor are sacred to you, just as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this land of yours, until the Day you meet your Lord. O Allah, have I conveyed (the message)? O Allah, be witness.'",
