    "english_translation": "Narrated by Tariq ibn Abdullah al-Muharabi: I was in the market of Dhu al-Majaz when a young man passed by me wearing a red striped cloak, saying: 'O people, say there is no deity except Allah and you will prosper!' A man behind him was throwing stones at him, having bloodied his heels and legs, saying: 'He is a liar, do not obey him!' I asked: 'Who is this?' They said: 'A boy from Bani Hashim who claims to be the Messenger of Allah, and this is his uncle Abd al-Uzza.' Later, when Muhammad ﷺ migrated to Madinah and people accepted Islam, we traveled from al-Rabadhah with a lady from our group. When we reached Madinah's outskirts, we changed our clothes. A man on the road asked us where we were from and where we were going. We told him we wanted to buy dates. He asked if we would sell our red camel. We agreed to a price in dates. He took the camel and left. We were worried, saying we had made a bad deal. A woman sitting with us said: 'I saw a man whose face was like a slice of the full moon's light. He will not wrong you or betray you, and I guarantee payment for your camel.' A man came and said: 'I am the Messenger of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Here are your dates. Eat, be satisfied, and measure.' We ate, measured, took full measure, and were satisfied.",
