He said: \"No, he is freed by Allah, and freed by His Messenger.\" And it was said that Abu Bakrah had testified against al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah with that testimony and was beaten with the prescribed punishment. He bore this against his brother Ziyad in his heart. When Mu'awiyah claimed Ziyad, Abu Bakrah forbade him from this, but Ziyad refused and agreed with Mu'awiyah. Abu Bakrah swore he would never speak to him again, and he died before speaking to him. Ziyad had honored the children of Abu Bakrah and elevated them, and gave them land grants and positions of authority, so they came to great wealth, and they claimed to be from the Arabs and from the descendants of Nafi' ibn al-Harith al-Thaqafi. Abu Bakrah died during the caliphate of Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan in Basra, during the governorship of Ziyad.",
