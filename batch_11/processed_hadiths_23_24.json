Then he said to him: 'O Dhu al-Jawshan, would you like to be among the first of this matter?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'What prevents you from it?' He replied: 'I saw your people denied you, expelled you, and fought you, so I am waiting. If you prevail over them, I will believe in you and follow you. If they prevail over you, I will not follow you.' So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him: 'O Dhu al-Jawshan, perhaps if you remain near I will see my triumph over them.' Then he said: 'By Allah, I was in a neighborhood when a rider from Makkah came to us. We asked: What news do you bring? He said: Muhammad has prevailed over the people of Makkah.
