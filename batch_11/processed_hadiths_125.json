      "english_translation": "Narrated by the brother of al-Dhahak ibn Muzahim: When death approached al-Dhahak, he sent for me and said: I do not think but that I will be dead between now and morning. So do not find me when I die calling out 'Al-Dhahak has died, al-Dhahak has died, whoever hears the call will come.' Strike your hand in my washing and increase in my mosques from fragrance and shroud me in shrouds from this whiteness in the middle from these shrouds. Beware of what people have innovated from this raised structure. Bury me in a grave. When men carry me on their shoulders, do not find me walking as a bride walks, walking between the two walks below the gallop and above the step. If you find brick then brick, otherwise from the dust of the earth. When you place me in my grave and have leveled the brick over me, raise a brick from beside the head of your brother, then look at his bed, then do your thing. When you bury me and the men have shaken their hands from me, stand at the head of my grave and face the qibla, then call three calls that your companions hear: O Allah, indeed You have seated al-Dhahak in his grave, You will question him about his Lord and about his religion and about his Prophet ﷺ, so establish him with the firm word in this life and the hereafter, then turn back.",
