He said: Come near and eat. I said: I am fasting. He said: Sit down so that I may narrate to you about fasting. In Affan's narration, he mentioned about prayer and fasting: Allah has relieved the traveler, the pregnant woman, and the nursing woman from fasting. By Allah, the Prophet ﷺ certainly said both or one of them. Woe is me, had I tasted from the food of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.",

I said: I am Kahmasa al-Hilali who came to you a year ago, and I have become very thin and my belly has shriveled. He said: What has brought you to this condition which I see? I said: I have not broken my fast during the day nor slept at night since you. He said: Who commanded you to torture yourself like this? Fast the month of patience and one day from every month.
