    "english_translation": "Muhammad ibn Umar informed us, saying: Abd al-Hamid ibn Ja'far narrated to me from his father, saying: When the delegation of Abd al-Qays arrived, it was said to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ: O Messenger of Allah, the delegation of Abd al-Qays (has arrived). He said: Welcome to them, they are an excellent people, Abd al-Qays. Their leader at that time was Abdullah ibn Awf al-Ashaj. They came together when they heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sitting in the mosque. They said: We will greet the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. So they came in their travel clothes and tied their riding animals at the door of the house of Ramlah daughter of al-Hadath. This was how delegations would do. So they greeted the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked them: Which one of you is Abdullah al-Ashaj? They said: He has come to you, O Messenger of Allah. Abdullah had put away his travel clothes and took out beautiful clothes and wore them. He was an ugly man. When he came, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked at an ugly man. Abdullah said: O Messenger of Allah, water is not drawn in the faces of men. Rather, what is needed from a man are his two smallest (parts): his tongue and his heart. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: You have two characteristics that Allah loves. Abdullah said: What are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Forbearance and clemency. Abdullah said: O Messenger of Allah, is this something that developed, or was I created with it? He said: Rather, you were created with it. Muhammad ibn Umar said: Others besides Abd al-Hamid ibn Ja'far mentioned in this hadith that the hospitality of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was provided to the delegation of Abd al-Qays for ten days. Abdullah al-Ashaj used to ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about jurisprudence and the Quran. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ would draw him near when he sat. He used to go to Ubay ibn Ka'b who would recite (the Quran) to him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered gifts to be given to the delegation and favored Abdullah al-Ashaj over them, giving him twelve ounces and a necklace (nasha), and this was the most that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would give to delegations.",
