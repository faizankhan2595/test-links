I saw that he disliked it greatly, and we saw the dislike on his face. Then he said: A man came to Hudhayfa and said: Pray to Allah to forgive me. He said: May Allah not forgive you. Then the man withdrew. Later he said: May Allah put you in the place of Hudhayfa. Are you satisfied now? He said: When one of you comes to a man as if he has ascertained his affair, Ibrahim mentioned the Sunnah and encouraged it, and mentioned what people have innovated and disliked it.",
