He said: Welcome to them, they are an excellent people, Abd al-Qays. Their leader at that time was Abdullah ibn Awf al-Ashaj. They came together when they heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was sitting in the mosque. They said: We will greet the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. So they came in their travel clothes and tied their riding animals at the door of the house of Ramlah daughter of al-Hadath. This was how delegations would do. So they greeted the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked them: Which one of you is Abdullah al-Ashaj? They said: He has come to you, O Messenger of Allah. Abdullah had put away his travel clothes and took out beautiful clothes and wore them. He was an ugly man. When he came, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ looked at an ugly man. Abdullah said: O Messenger of Allah, water is not drawn in the faces of men. Rather, what is needed from a man are his two smallest (parts): his tongue and his heart. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: You have two characteristics that Allah loves. Abdullah said: What are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Forbearance and clemency. Abdullah said: O Messenger of Allah, is this something that developed, or was I created with it? He said: Rather, you were created with it. Muhammad ibn Umar said: Others besides Abd al-Hamid ibn Ja'far mentioned in this hadith that the hospitality of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was provided to the delegation of Abd al-Qays for ten days. Abdullah al-Ashaj used to ask the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about jurisprudence and the Quran. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ would draw him near when he sat. He used to go to Ubay ibn Ka'b who would recite (the Quran) to him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered gifts to be given to the delegation and favored Abdullah al-Ashaj over them, giving him twelve ounces and a necklace (nasha), and this was the most that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ would give to delegations.",

I said: What are they? He said: Forbearance and shame. I said: Is this something that developed or was I created with it? He said: Rather, it was from of old. I said: Praise be to Allah who created me with two characteristics that Allah loves. (End of first version). He (the narrator) also said: It reached me that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to al-Ashaj of Abd al-Qays: 'You have two characteristics that Allah loves.' He said: What are they, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Forbearance and shame. He said: Is this something I acquired in Islam or was I created with it? He said: Rather, you were created with it. He said: Praise be to Allah who created me with what Allah loves. (End of second version). As for Hisham ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ib al-Kalbi, he reported from his father that al-Ashaj of Abd al-Qays's name was al-Mundhir ibn al-Harith ibn Amr ibn Ziyad ibn Asr ibn Awf ibn Amr ibn Awf ibn Juthimah ibn Awf ibn Bakr ibn Awf ibn Anmar ibn Amr ibn Wadiah ibn Lukayz ibn Afsá ibn Abd al-Qays ibn Afsá ibn Du'mi ibn Judilah ibn Asad ibn Rabi'ah. As for Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Abi Sayf, he is al-Madaini, he said: His name was al-Mundhir ibn Aidh ibn al-Harith ibn al-Mundhir ibn al-Nu'man ibn Ziyad ibn Asr. He also said: Abd al-Wahhab ibn Ata' informed us from Awf from al-Hasan, saying: It reached us that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to Aidh ibn al-Mundhir al-Ashaj...  He also said: Muhammad ibn Bishr al-Abdi said: I asked our Shaykh al-Buhtari about the name of al-Ashaj, so he said: 'His name was al-Mundhir ibn Aidh.'",
