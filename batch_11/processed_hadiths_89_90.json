      "english_translation": "He is known as Hijr al-Khair (Hijr the Good), and his father Adi was al-Adbar (the one who turned his back) because he turned his back while fleeing, so he was given that name. Hijr ibn Adi was a pagan-then-Muslim, and it is mentioned that some of the scholars of knowledge said that he came as a delegation to the Prophet ﷺ along with his brother Hani ibn Adi. Hijr witnessed the Battle of Qadisiyyah, and he was the one who conquered Marj 'Adhra. He was among those receiving two thousand five hundred from the stipends. He was from the Companions of Ali ibn Abi Talib and witnessed with him the Battle of the Camel and Siffin. When Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan came as governor of Kufa, he called for Hijr ibn Adi and said: 'Know that I know you, and I and you were as you know'—meaning regarding the love of Ali ibn Abi Talib—'but matters have changed now. I adjure you by Allah not to let even a drop of your blood fall so that I may not have to shed it all. Control your tongue and let your house suffice you. This is my gathering place, so it is your gathering place, and your needs shall be fulfilled by me. Relieve me of yourself, for I know your haste. I adjure you, Abu Abdur-Rahman, concerning yourself, and beware of these lowly people and these foolish ones lest they lead you astray from your opinion, for if you became worthless to me or despicable regarding your right, I would not have chosen you for this from my own self.' Hijr said: 'I have understood.' Then he departed to his house. His brothers from the Shi'a came to him and said: 'What did the commander say to you?' He said: 'He said to me thus and thus.' They said: 'Did he advise you?' He remained while bearing hatred for [open] opposition. The Shi'a began coming to visit him, saying: 'You are our elder and the most worthy of the people to denounce this matter.' When he came to the mosque they walked with him. So 'Amru ibn Harith, who was at that time the deputy of Ziyad over Kufa while Ziyad was in Basra, sent word to him: 'Abu Abdur-Rahman, what is this gathering? Yet you gave the commander from yourself what you knew.' He said to the messenger: 'Do you denounce what you are in? Go away, for behind you is more space.' So 'Amru ibn Harith wrote about that to Ziyad, and wrote to him: 'If you have a need in Kufa, hasten it.' So Ziyad prepared to march until he came to Kufa. He sent to Adi ibn Hatim, Jarir ibn Abdillah al-Bajali, Khalid ibn Arfatah al-'Adhri, an ally of the Banu Zahra, and to a group of the nobles of the people of Kufa, and he sent them to Hijr ibn Adi to excuse himself to him and forbid him from this gathering and [to command him to] restrain his tongue from what he spoke. They came to him, but he did not respond to them about anything, nor did he speak to any of them, and he began saying: 'O boy, feed the young camel.' It is said the camel was in a corner of the house. Adi ibn Hatim said to him: 'Are you mad? I am speaking to you as I am speaking, and you are saying: O boy, feed the young camel?' Adi said to his companions: 'I did not think this wretch had reached such weakness as I see.' So the people stood up and left him, and they came to Ziyad and informed him of some while keeping back some, and they beautified his affair and asked Ziyad to be gentle with him. He said: 'Then I am not [a true son of] Abu Sufyan.' So he sent the police and the guards to him. He fought them with those with him, then they dispersed from him. He was brought to Ziyad, along with his companions. He said to him: 'Woe to you, what is the matter with you?' He said: 'Indeed, I am upon my pledge to Mu'awiyah; I will not break it nor turn from it.' Ziyad gathered seventy of the chief men of Kufa and said: 'Write your testimony against Hijr and his companions,' and they did. Then he sent them as a delegation to Mu'awiyah and sent Hijr and his companions to him. The news reached 'Aisha, so she sent 'Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham al-Makhzumi to Mu'awiyah asking him to let them go free. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Uthman al-Thaqafi said: 'O Commander of the Believers, its destruction! its destruction! Do not burden yourself after the year with disgrace.' Mu'awiyah said: 'I do not love to see them, but bring me the letter of Ziyad.' So the letter was read to him, and the witnesses came and testified. Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan said: 'Take them out to 'Adhrah and kill them there.' It is said they were carried to it. Hijr said: 'What is this village?' They said: ''Adhrah.' He said: 'Praise be to Allah! By Allah, I am the first Muslim whose dogs barked in its [defense] for the sake of Allah. Then I have been brought to it today in chains.' Each man of them was handed over to a man from the people of Sham to kill him. Hijr was handed over to a man from Himyar, and he was brought forward to be killed. He said: 'O you people, allow me to pray two units.' They allowed him. He performed ablution and prayed two units, making them lengthy. It was said to him: 'You made them lengthy; are you afraid?' He withdrew and said: 'I have never performed ablution except that I prayed, and I have never prayed a prayer shorter than this one. Even if I feared, I have seen an unsheathed sword, a spread shroud, and a dug grave.' It is said that their families came with the shrouds and dug graves for them. It is said rather that Mu'awiyah was the one who dug the graves for them and sent them the shrouds. Hijr said: 'O Allah, we seek justice against our community, for the people of Iraq testified against us, and the people of Sham killed us.' It is said that Hijr was told: 'Stretch out your neck.' He said: 'That is blood that I would not help [spill].' So he was brought forward and his neck was struck. Mu'awiyah had sent a man from the Banu Salaman ibn Sa'd called Hudba ibn Fiyaz to kill them, and he was one-eyed. A man from Khath'am looked at him and said: 'If the birds speak truth, half of us will be killed and half of us will be saved.' It is said that when seven were killed, Mu'awiyah followed up with a messenger with the order to pardon them all, [and] seven were killed and six were saved, or seven were killed and seven were saved. It is said that they were thirteen men. 'Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Harith ibn Hisham came to Mu'awiyah with the message from 'Aisha after they had been killed. He said: 'O Commander of the Believers, where did the wisdom of Abu Sufyan escape from concerning you?' He said: 'It was hidden from me by someone like you from my people.' There was Hind bint Zaid ibn Makhrabah al-Ansariyyah, and she was a Shi'a, and she said when Hijr was sent to Mu'awiyah: [Poetry about Hijr and his death follows...]",
