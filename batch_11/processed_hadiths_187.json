He replied: He is obeyed in his gathering, protective of what is behind his back. Then al-Zibriqan said: O Prophet of Allah, he knows that I am better than what he said, but he envies me. Then Amr said: You as I know you are a seeker of honor, narrow in your bearing, foolish in your father, vile in your uncle. Then he said: O Prophet of Allah, I did not lie in the first nor in the latter, I was pleased with him, so I said about him the best I knew, so it angered me, so I said what I knew about him. So the Prophet ﷺ said: Indeed, from speech is magic.",

Uthman was the youngest of them. He came to the Prophet ﷺ before them, embraced Islam, and the Prophet ﷺ taught him Quran and he stayed with Ubayy ibn Ka'b who taught him Quran. When the delegation of Thaqif wanted to depart to al-Ta'if, they said: O Prophet of Allah, appoint a leader over us. So he appointed Uthman ibn Abi al-As al-Thaqafi over them and said: \"Indeed he is intelligent and has memorized portions of the Quran.\" They said: We will not change a leader appointed by the Prophet ﷺ. He went with them to al-Ta'if and led them in prayer and taught them the Quran. When it was the time of Umar ibn al-Khattab and he built Basra and settled there with the Muslims who wished to settle, he desired to appoint over it a man of intelligence, wisdom and competence. He was told: Get Uthman ibn Abi al-As. He said: That is a leader appointed by the Prophet ﷺ, and I will not remove him. They said to him: Write to him to appoint a successor over al-Ta'if and come to you. He said: Yes, I will do that. So he wrote to him and he appointed his brother al-Hakam ibn Abi al-As al-Thaqafi as successor over al-Ta'if and came to Umar who sent him to Basra. He built there a house and extracted wealth from it, including the canal of Uthman which is attributed to him near al-Ableah and its land. His children remained to this day and became honored, increased in their property and wealth, and had many descendants with a good legacy.",
