When the lock was broken and they entered, there was a large hall with a golden bed on which lay a man. When they measured him, his height was twelve spans. He wore ornate garments woven with gold. Next to him was a golden staff with a red ruby on its head. The man was white-headed and bearded with two long locks of hair. Next to him was a tablet inscribed in Himyarite script: 'By Your name, O Allah, Lord of Himyar. I am Hassan ibn Amr al-Qil, when there is no lord but Allah. I lived with hope and died with an appointed term. In the days of Wakhz Hehid, and what is Wakhz Hehid? Twelve thousand chiefs perished in it, and I was their last to be killed. I came to the mountain of Dhu al-Shi'abayn to protect me from death, but it failed me.' Next to him was a sword inscribed in Himyarite: 'I am Qubar, by me vengeance is obtained.'",

Hope for what you do not know, but do not be a Murji'ite. Know that good is from Allah and evil is from yourself, but do not be a Qadarite. Love whoever you see doing good, even if he is a blind Sindian. Muhammad ibn Sa'd said: Our companions said: Al-Sha'bi was among those who went out with the Qur'an-reciters against al-Hajjaj and witnessed Dar al-Jamajim. He escaped and hid for a while. He wrote to Yazid ibn Abi Muslim to intercede with al-Hajjaj for him, but Yazid replied: 'By Allah, I do not dare do that. But wait until he sits in public assembly, then stand before him, excuse yourself, acknowledge your sin, and ask me to testify for you on anything you wish, and I will testify for you.' Al-Sha'bi did so. Al-Hajjaj suddenly found him standing before him. He asked: 'Are you al-Sha'bi?' Al-Sha'bi replied: 'Yes, may Allah set the affairs of the Commander in order.' Al-Hajjaj said: 'Did I not grant you entry to this land and increase your stipend when you were already receiving a handsome amount, as none like you receive? Al-Sha'bi answered: 'Yes, may Allah set your affairs in order.' Al-Hajjaj asked: 'Did I not command that you lead your people in prayer as no one like you does?' Al-Sha'bi replied: 'Yes, may Allah set your affairs in order.' Al-Hajjaj said: 'Did I not honor you among your people as none like you are honored?' Al-Sha'bi answered: 'Yes, may Allah set your affairs in order.' Al-Hajjaj asked: 'Did I not send you on a mission to the Commander of the Believers as none like you are sent?' Al-Sha'bi replied: 'Yes, may Allah set your affairs in order.' Al-Hajjaj asked: 'Then what drove you to go out with an enemy of Rahman?' Al-Sha'bi said: 'May Allah set your affairs in order. We were caught up in a trial. In it we were neither righteous pious people nor mighty sinners. I have written to Yazid ibn Abi Muslim informing him of my repentance for what I have done wrong and my recognition of the right from which I went out. I asked him to inform you and secure amnesty for me from you, but he did not do so.' Al-Hajjaj turned to Yazid and asked: 'Is this true, Yazid?' Yazid replied: 'Yes, may Allah set your affairs in order.' Al-Hajjaj asked: 'Then what prevented you from informing me of his letter?' Yazid answered: 'The preoccupation the Commander was involved in.' Al-Hajjaj said: 'Go then.' Al-Sha'bi departed to his house safe and secure.",
