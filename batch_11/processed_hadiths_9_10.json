Follow their example and listen to their words. I have given you preference with Abdullah over myself. Waki' added: I have made Ibn Mas'ud the treasurer of your wealth and sent Uthman ibn Hunayf over the territory. I give them provisions daily - half and the organs for Ammar ibn Yasir and the remaining half among these. Also, Qabisah ibn Uqbah narrated: Sufyan narrated from al-Ajlah or someone else from Abdullah ibn Abi al-Hudhayl: That Umar gave provisions to Ammar, Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, and Uthman ibn Hunayf daily - for Ammar half and the organs, for Abdullah a quarter, and for Uthman a quarter every day.",
