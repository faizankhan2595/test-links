In another narration from Zubayd: Abd al-Rahman ibn al-Aswad used to lead his people in twelve units of Tarawih prayer in Ramadan, and between every two units he would pray twelve units for himself, and he would recite a third of the Quran each night.

Sometimes Hammad said: 'He bent his back.' In another narration from Sharik through Ali ibn Thabit: Abu al-Bakhtari used to listen to mourning (funeral dirges) and weep. In another narration from al-Rabi' ibn Hassan: I saw Abu al-Bakhtari praying in a garment. Muhammad ibn Sa'd said on the authority of Haggaj from Shu'bah: 'Abu al-Bakhtari did not encounter Ali nor see him.'",
