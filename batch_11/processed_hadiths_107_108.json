Habib said: He rode and I rode with him until we reached the toll station. A man came to us who used to carve ships before this for those before him. He entered the ship carrying a sieve. Said ibn Jubayr said to him, 'No, no,' and expelled him. Then Said ibn Jubayr looked, being the first time he rode to it, at those who came before him with merchandise from the People of the Covenant (Christians/Jews), and he did not demand anything from them and did not believe they owed tithes. And he looked at those from the Muslims and took from them the alms-tax of what was with them. It was said: And Said ibn Jubayr was among those readers who rebelled against al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf and witnessed Dar al-Jimahjim.",

When the people of Dar al-Jimahjim were defeated, Said ibn Jubayr fled to Makkah. Khalid ibn Abdullah captured him and took him to al-Hajjaj along with Ismail ibn Awsat al-Bajali. Their chief was Zayd ibn Masruq, one of the Banu Dubari. Ismail ibn Awsat brought him to al-Hajjaj, and al-Hajjaj said to him: 'Did I not come to Iraq and honor you? Did I not do things for you?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'What made you come out against me?' He said: 'There was a pledge to Ibn al-Ash'ath on my neck, and I was urged on.' Al-Hajjaj became angry and said: 'You saw obligation for Allah's enemy urged against you as binding, and didn't see obligation for Allah, or the Commander of the Believers, or me? By Allah, I will not raise my feet until I kill you and hasten you to the Fire. Bring me a sword.' Muslim al-A'war stood with a broad Hanafi sword and struck his neck. Al-Hasan used to say: 'It is amazing about Said ibn Jubayr - he fought al-Hajjaj, ordered people to fight him, then fled, came to Makkah, and couldn't restrain himself.' Muhammad ibn Umar said: Said ibn Jubayr was killed in the year ninety-four, and he was forty-nine years old at that time.",
