While I was doing that, he moved the cloth thus and uncovered his face, then he returned as the best he had been. He had previously been severely ill. He said: Peace be upon you. I said: And upon you be the mercy of Allah. He said: Glory be to Allah! Is it after death, O my brother? He said: I have met my Lord after you, I was welcomed with mercy and fragrance, and a Lord who is not angry. He clothed me in green garments of silk and brocade. I found the matter easier than what is in your souls. And do not be beguiled, for I have asked permission from my Lord to give you glad tidings. Carry me to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, for he promised me that he would not precede me until I catch up with him.
