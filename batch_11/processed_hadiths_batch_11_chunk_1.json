When Suwayd came, al-Hajjaj asked: 'What made you call the Adhan at noon?' Suwayd replied: 'I did it with Abu Bakr and Umar.' Then al-Hajjaj said: 'Do not call the Adhan for your people, nor lead them in prayer.' Al-Hajjaj commanded them to remove him from calling the Adhan and leading prayer. Also it is mentioned that Suwayd ibn Ghafalah was hiding during the time of al-Hajjaj, and people used to pray the Zuhr on Friday in congregation. Additionally, Suwayd ibn Ghafalah used to pass by us in the mosque to his wife from Bani Asad, and he was one hundred twenty-seven years old, sometimes he would bow and sometimes he would not. Also, Suwayd ibn Ghafalah shrouded al-Ubayriq ibn Malik in two garments.",
