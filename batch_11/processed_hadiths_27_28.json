So I went until I stood on the road at Arafah, and the processions passed by me, until a large procession was lifted up for me. So I looked and recognized the Prophet ﷺ among them by the description. When he came near me, a man from the people called out to me and then said: Let the faces of the beasts be clear. So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Leave the man, for he has a need. So I came forward until I took hold of the halter of his she-camel or its rope, and I said: Tell me of a deed which will enter me into Paradise and remove me from the Fire. He said: And is that what you want? I said: Yes. He said: Then keep it in mind: worship Allah and do not associate anything with Him, establish prayer, give Zakat, fast Ramadan, perform pilgrimage to the House, and do to people what you love to be done to you, and hate for the people what you hate to be done to you. Leave the riding animal.",
