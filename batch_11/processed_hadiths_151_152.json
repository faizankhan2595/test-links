Al-Sa'ib ibn Bishr was killed with Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr. About them, Ibn Warqa al-Nakh'i said: [poetry follows].

Muhammad ibn Sa'd said: His son Hisham ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ib informed me of all this. He was knowledgeable in genealogy and the hadith traditions and history of the Arabs, but the scholars say about him: He is not reliable; in his narration he is very weak.",
