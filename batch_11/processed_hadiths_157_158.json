He continued: People used to think that Sufyan took gifts from rulers once, then stopped accepting anything from anyone. He used to trade in Yemen and distribute what he had among his brothers who would trade with it for him. He would meet them at the season (of hajj) every year and settle accounts with them, taking the profit. He had about two hundred dinars. He had a son, and there was nothing more beloved to him than that son. He wished to have a son. When his son died, after his death, he made his sister and her children his heirs, not his brother al-Mubarak ibn Sa'id. When Sufyan was sought (by the authorities), he fled to Mecca. The Caliph al-Mahdi wrote to Muhammad ibn Ibrahim who was the governor of Mecca, seeking him. Muhammad sent word to Sufyan asking if he wanted to come to them openly so he could be sent, or hide. Sufyan hid. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim sought him and commanded a herald to announce in Mecca: whoever brings Sufyan will receive such and such. He remained hidden in Mecca, appearing only to scholars and those who did not fear him.",

    "english_translation": "Narrated from Abd al-Rahman ibn Ishaq, from Said ibn Sulaiman, from Abu Shihab al-Hannat, who said: Sufyan al-Thawri's sister sent with me a bag containing cookies and sweets to Sufyan who was in Mecca. When I arrived in Mecca, I asked about him and was told he usually sits behind the Ka'ba near the entrance of the spice merchants. I found him there reclining. When I greeted him, he did not return my greeting as he normally did. When I told him his sister sent him food that was worth nothing, he sat up and talked to me. I said: Abu Abdullah, I came as your friend, greeted you, and you did not return my greeting properly. But when I told you about cookies worth nothing, you sat and talked to me. He said: O Abu Shihab, do not blame me, for these three days I have not tasted anything. I excused him. They said: When Sufyan feared in Mecca from being sought, he went to Basra. When he arrived, he stayed near Yahya ibn Sa'id al-Qattan. He asked the neighbors if any hadith scholars lived nearby. They said yes, Yahya ibn Sa'id. He said: Bring him to me. When Yahya came, Sufyan said: I have been here six or seven days. Yahya moved him to his quarter and opened a door between them. He brought the hadith scholars of Basra to greet him and learn from him. Among those who visited him were Jarir ibn Hazim, al-Mubarak ibn Fadala, Hammad ibn Salama, Marhumm al-Attar, Hammad ibn Zayd, and others. Abd al-Rahman ibn Mahdi came and accompanied him. Yahya and Abd al-Rahman used to write from him during those days. They spoke to Abu Awana to visit him but he refused, saying: How can I visit a man who does not know me? This was because Abu Awana greeted Sufyan in Mecca but Sufyan did not return his greeting. When asked about this, Sufyan said: I do not know him. When Sufyan feared that his staying near Yahya ibn Sa'id would become known, he asked Yahya to move him. Yahya moved him to the house of al-Haitham ibn Mansur al-A'raji from Banu Sa'd ibn Zayd Manah ibn Tamim. When Hammad ibn Zayd spoke to him about abandoning the authorities, saying this is the way of the people of bid'ah and what do you fear from them, Sufyan and Hammad agreed to go to Baghdad. Sufyan wrote to al-Mahdi or to Ya'qub ibn Dawud, beginning with himself, but was told they would be angry, so he began with them. He received a reply with courtesy, honor, and obedience. He was about to go to them when he fell ill with a severe fever and death approached. He was afraid, but Marhumm ibn Abd al-Aziz said to him: O Abu Abdullah, why this fear? You are going to your Lord whom you used to worship. He calmed down. He said: Look who from our Kufan companions is here. They sent to Abbadan. Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Abjar and al-Hasan ibn Ayyash, brother of Abi Bakr ibn Ayyash, came to him. He entrusted to Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd al-Malik and asked him to pray over him. They stayed with him until he died. His funeral was brought out to the people of Basra suddenly. They heard of his death. A large crowd attended. Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd al-Malik prayed over him. He was a righteous man approved by Sufyan for himself. He descended into his grave with him and Khalid ibn al-Harith and others descended. They buried him. Then Abd al-Rahman ibn Abd al-Malik and al-Hasan ibn Ayyash went to Kufa and informed its people of the death of Sufyan, may Allah have mercy on him.",
