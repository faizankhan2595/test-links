    "english_translation": "Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ib al-Kalbi is called Abu al-Nadhr. His grandfather was Bishr ibn Amr, and his sons were al-Sa'ib, Ubayd, and Abd al-Rahman, who witnessed the Battle of the Camel with Ali ibn Abi Talib (may peace be upon him). Al-Sa'ib ibn Bishr was killed with Mus'ab ibn al-Zubayr. About them, Ibn Warqa al-Nakh'i said: [poetry follows]. Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ib witnessed the Battle of the Skulls with Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath. Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ib was knowledgeable in Quranic exegesis, Arab genealogies, and their hadith traditions. He died in Kufa in the year 146 AH during the caliphate of Abu Ja'far. Muhammad ibn Sa'd said: His son Hisham ibn Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ib informed me of all this. He was knowledgeable in genealogy and the hadith traditions and history of the Arabs, but the scholars say about him: He is not reliable; in his narration he is very weak.",
