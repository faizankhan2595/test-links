    "english_translation": "Narrated that Jawshan ibn Rabi'a al-Kilabi came to the Prophet ﷺ and gifted him a horse while he was still a polytheist. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ refused to accept it from him. He said: 'If you wish, sell it to me for the fine armors from Badr.' Then he said to him: 'O Dhu al-Jawshan, would you like to be among the first of this matter?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'What prevents you from it?' He replied: 'I saw your people denied you, expelled you, and fought you, so I am waiting. If you prevail over them, I will believe in you and follow you. If they prevail over you, I will not follow you.' So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to him: 'O Dhu al-Jawshan, perhaps if you remain near I will see my triumph over them.' Then he said: 'By Allah, I was in a neighborhood when a rider from Makkah came to us. We asked: What news do you bring? He said: Muhammad has prevailed over the people of Makkah. So Dhu al-Jawshan grieved over his leaving Islam when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called him to it'",
