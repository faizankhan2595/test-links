His mother was Humainah bint Sufyan ibn Umayyah ibn Abd Shams ibn Abd Manaf ibn Qusai. He witnessed Badr, and he was the one who conquered Al-Qadisiyyah. He settled in Kufa and organized it with divisions for the Arab tribes, built a house in it, and was its governor for Umar ibn al-Khattab and Uthman ibn Affan. Then he was removed from it, and Al-Walid ibn Uqbah ibn Abi Mu'ayt became its governor after him. Sa'd returned to Madinah and died in his palace at Al-Aqiq, ten miles from Madinah. He was carried on the shoulders of men and buried in Al-Baqi'. This was in the year fifty-five. Marwan ibn al-Hakm, who was the governor of Madinah for Mu'awiyah at that time, led the prayer over him. When Sa'd died, he was about seventy years old, and his eyesight had gone. Thus Muhammad ibn Umar said regarding the time of his death, and others said: He died in the year fifty. We have written his account among those who witnessed Badr.",
