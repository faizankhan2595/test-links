    "english_translation": "Al-Aswad ibn Yazid was from Mudhaj with the kunya Abu Amr. He was the uncle of Alqamah ibn Qays, and al-Aswad was older than Alqamah. He brought the dower of Alqamah's mother. Al-Aswad narrated from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq that he performed the hajj with him. He also narrated from Umar, Ali, Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, Mu'adh ibn Jabal (whom he heard from in Yemen before his migration when the Prophet ﷺ sent Mu'adh to Yemen), Salman, Abu Musa, and Aisha, but he did not narrate anything from Uthman. It is mentioned that al-Aswad used to fast perpetually. Also, al-Aswad used to fast even on intensely hot days when even strong red camels would stagger from the heat. Additionally, al-Aswad would fast during journeys until his tongue would turn black from the heat, while his companions would drink several times before finishing their journey on non-Ramadan days.",

Also: al-Aswad would stop his camel when prayer time came, even if on a stone. Moreover: al-Aswad circumambulated the Kaaba eighty times between Hajj and Umrah. Al-Aswad would enter the state of ihram from his house, while Alqamah would enjoy his garments. Both Fadl ibn Dukain and Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Asadi narrated: Sufyan narrated from Mansur from Ibrahim that al-Aswad would enter ihram from his house while Alqamah would benefit from his clothes. Also: I saw al-Aswad and Amr ibn Maymun entering ihram from Kufa. Furthermore, al-Aswad would leave Kufa in the state of ihram with matted hair.
