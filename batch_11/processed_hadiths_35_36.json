I heard him say: \"I have never done a deed that I fear more will enter me into the Fire than this deed of mine. I did not take a single gold dinar or silver dirham, nor did I wrong any Muslim or a person under covenant, but I do not know what this rope (innovation) is which the Prophet ﷺ did not establish, nor did Abu Bakr nor 'Umar establish.\" He (Shaqiq) said: I said to him: \"What made you return to it when you had abandoned it?\" He said: \"Ziyad and Surayh and the Devil encompassed me, and they kept beautifying it for me until they caused me to fall into it.\"",

She said: Then we would sprinkle his grave with wine (alcohol). Then he came to us in a dream and said: If you must do something, do it with sprinkling (water), and he died at al-Silsilah at Wasit. He (Ahmad) said: I was informed by Sufyan ibn 'Uyaynah, saying: Masruq remained after 'Alqamah, none would be preferred over him.
