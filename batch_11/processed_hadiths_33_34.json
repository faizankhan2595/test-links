Indeed, Allah is with you, Most Merciful (Quran 4:29). Would that have been a barrier between you? They said: Yes.

Indeed, Allah is with you, Most Merciful (Quran 4:29). Would they obey? He said: I said: Yes, unless they were deaf stones. He said: By Allah, indeed it has descended from the sky with His chosen one from the People of the Sky upon His chosen one from the People of the Earth, and they did not obey, and that they believe in it unseen is better than that they believe in it through witnessing.",
