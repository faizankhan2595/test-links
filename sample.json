  "english_translation": "Narrated by Ibn Abbas: The delegation of Abdul-Qais came to the Prophet ﷺ. He said: \"Who is the delegation or who are the people?\" They said: \"Rabi'ah.\" He said: \"Welcome to the people or to the delegation, without disgrace or regret.\" They said: \"We come to you from a distant land, and between us and you is this tribe of disbelieving Mudar, and we cannot come to you except in a sacred month. So command us with something by which we may inform those behind us and enter Paradise.\" So he commanded them with four things and forbade them from four things. He commanded them with belief in Allah alone. He said: \"Do you know what belief in Allah alone is?\" They said: \"Allah and His Messenger know best.\" He said: \"Bearing witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing prayer, giving Zakat, fasting Ramadan, and giving the Khumus from the spoils of war.\" And he forbade them from certain vessels.",
