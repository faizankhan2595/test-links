They shall not reach that place where the transgression occurred except while in a state of Iḥrām. When they reach it, they must separate until they complete their rituals, and each of them must offer a sacrificial animal. And Zaid ibn Ali said: Whoever completed all the rituals except the circumambulation, then had intercourse with his family, his Ḥajj is nullified, and the obligation for Ḥajj returns upon him next year, and he must offer a sacrificial animal for what he nullified in his Ḥajj. And Zaid ibn Ali said regarding the muḥrim kissing his wife: He must offer a sacrificial animal - a sheep. If he has an emission, then he owes the like of that, and his Ḥajj is complete.",

Indeed, my prayer, my sacrifice, my life and my death are for Allah, Lord of the worlds, with no partner for Him. With this I have been commanded, and I am from those who submit.
