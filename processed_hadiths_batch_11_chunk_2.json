      "english_translation": "Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Sha'bani reported: Some scholars from Sha'ban told us, among them Muhammad ibn Abi Umayyah, a learned man, that when rain fell on Yemen, a flood exposed a vault with a stone door. When the lock was broken and they entered, there was a large hall with a golden bed on which lay a man. When they measured him, his height was twelve spans. He wore ornate garments woven with gold. Next to him was a golden staff with a red ruby on its head. The man was white-headed and bearded with two long locks of hair. Next to him was a tablet inscribed in Himyarite script: 'By Your name, O Allah, Lord of Himyar. I am Hassan ibn Amr al-Qil, when there is no lord but Allah. I lived with hope and died with an appointed term. In the days of Wakhz Hehid, and what is Wakhz Hehid? Twelve thousand chiefs perished in it, and I was their last to be killed. I came to the mountain of Dhu al-Shi'abayn to protect me from death, but it failed me.' Next to him was a sword inscribed in Himyarite: 'I am Qubar, by me vengeance is obtained.'",
