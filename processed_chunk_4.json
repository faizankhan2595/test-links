And it was related to us that the House was built from five mountains: from Hira, Lebanon, al-Judi, Mount Sinai, and Mount of Olives. And it was related to us that the House descended with Adam when he descended, saying: I send down with you a House around which will be circumambulated as around My Throne, so Adam and those believers after him circumambulated around it, until the time of the flood when Allah drowned the people of Noah, He raised it and purified it... (long narrative about the Kaaba's history including discovery of inscriptions and the Prophet ﷺ's sermon on the day of the conquest of Makkah regarding the sanctity of Makkah)",
