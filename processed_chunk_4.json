I wish I could see my brothers. They said: Are we not your brothers, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Rather, you are my companions. My brothers are those who come after me, and I am their precursor at the Pond. They said: O Messenger of Allah, how will you know those who come after you? He said: Do you not see that if a man had white-marked horses among dark horses, would he not recognize his horses? They said: Yes, O Messenger of Allah. He said: They will come on the Day of Judgment with white marks from the traces of ablution, and I am their precursor at the Pond. Certainly, some men will be driven away from my Pond as the stray camel is driven away. I will call them, but it will be said: They have changed things after you. Then I will say: Woe, woe to them.",
