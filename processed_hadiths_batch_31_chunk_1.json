He said: Speak justice and advance mercy. He said: I cannot do that. He said: Feed the food and spread the greeting, and pray while the people are sleeping. Shu'bah doubted about spreading the greeting, though he mentioned it. He said: I cannot do that. He said: Do you have camels? He said: Yes. He said: Look at a camel in them and a water-skin, then look at a family who do not find water except occasionally, so water them. Perhaps your water-skin will not be pierced and your camel will not diminish until Paradise becomes due for you.",
