Hassan al-Wasiti said from Khallad ibn Sulayman that he asked Ibn Umar. Then I said: Nafi' narrated to me. Then I said: I do not establish it from him. He said: We went out and did not know which faction was our leader or our camp. He said: The faction is the Messenger of Allah. I said: Allah says: O you who have believed, when you meet those who disbelieve. He said: It was revealed concerning the people of Badr, not before it nor after it. And he heard Abu Sa'd from Abu Hurayrah, he is counted among the Basrians. Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahim narrated to us. He said: Mansur ibn Salamah narrated to us. Khallad ibn Salamah said: He is al-Hadrami. We were near Khalid ibn Abi Imran. He said: Nafi' ibn Abi Nafi' narrated to me, he is the son of Umm Nafi', his kunya is Abu Abdullah, from Umar.",
