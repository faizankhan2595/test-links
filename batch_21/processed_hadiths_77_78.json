However, in this hadith he uses the direct transmission term 'akhbarahum' (أَخْبَرَهُمْ), which provides explicit indication of direct narration. While Ibn Jurayj's tadlis is a concern, his use of explicit transmission terms here mitigates the issue. Moreover, Ibn Jurayj is still considered Thiqah (trustworthy) by the majority of scholars despite his tadlis."
