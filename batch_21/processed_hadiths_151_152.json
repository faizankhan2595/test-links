Aslam, may Allah save them. Usiyyah disobeyed Allah and His Messenger. O Allah curse Bani Lahyan, curse Ruel and Dhakwan.' Then he would fall into prostration. Khaffaf said: Thus the curse of the disbelievers came from him. Ismail ibn Ja'far also reported: Ibn Harmulah informed me from Hanzalah ibn Ali ibn al-Asqaa from Khaffaf ibn Imaa the same.
