Verily you are praiseworthy and glorious. And David ibn Qais narrated from Nu'aym al-Mujmir from Abu Hurayrah the prayer upon Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. And Abdullah ibn Maslamah from Malik from Nu'aym, heard Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Zayd from Ibn Mas'ud from Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, and this is more authentic.
