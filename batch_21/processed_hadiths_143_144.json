From Osama ibn Zayd al-Lithi, from Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir, he said: I heard Safina (the Prophet's servant) saying: I boarded a ship and it sank. I came out onto a plank and the sea threw me onto a thicket. A lion approached stretching itself. I said: O Father of Harith, I am a client (mawla) of the Prophet ﷺ. So it came and bowed its head, then nudged me, and kept pushing me forward until it placed me on the road. Then it growled, and I thought it was saying farewell to me. Then it turned away from me and left me. Abd al-Razzaq also reported it from Ma'mar from Said ibn Abd al-Rahman.",
