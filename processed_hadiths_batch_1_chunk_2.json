      "english_translation": "Abu Nuaym narrated to us from al-Abbas from Abu Ishaq from Said ibn Jubayr from Nafi' ibn al-Azraq that he asked Ibn Abbas about the verse: Faces gleaming on that Day, gazing toward their Lord. Ibn Abbas said: He is the One who has no equal, meaning He does not look upon the people of the Fire with mercy, and the people of Paradise look toward Him in His reward, honor, and mercy, yet they do not see Him with their eyes because He said: No sight can grasp Him. Then al-Dahhak and Ibrahim and Makbul and al-Zuhri said: They look toward the reward, and Allah is not seen by anyone from creation. Al-Hasan said: Gazing toward the might of their Lord and His power and management. Gleaming means brightness in faces and joy in hearts. Said ibn Jubayr said: Gleaming means beauty toward their Lord. Gazing means waiting for the reward of their Lord, and Allah is not seen by anyone. Said ibn al-Musayyib said: Gleaming means blessed. Gazing means waiting for the reward of their Lord, and Allah is not seen by anyone.",

He replied: Allah the Most High said: There is no secret counsel of three but He is their fourth, nor of five but He is their sixth, nor of fewer than that nor more but that He is with them wherever they may be. Thus Allah the Most High informed that no place is empty of Him, and that He is present observing in every place, overseeing and managing all affairs, not even a speck is hidden from Him in the heavens or on earth. Allah said: We are nearer to him than his life vein. He also said: He is Allah in the heavens and on earth; He knows your secrets and your declarations and He knows what you earn. He said to Moses and Aaron: Verily, I am with you; I hear and I see. He said: They hide themselves from people but they cannot hide from Allah while He is with them when they plot what is not pleasing of statement. He said: And they comprehend not Him in knowledge. He said: And there is none equal to Him. He said: Do you know of any comparable to Him? He said: He is established upon the Throne. He said: Unto Him ascends the good word and the righteous deed raises it. He said: Are you secure against He who is in the heaven? He said: He manages the affair from the heavens to the earth. And similar verses from the Quran testify that Allah is not absent from any place in the highest heavens and lowest earths, and it is not permissible to take some of the Quran without other parts for one confirms the other, and He is established upon the Throne, and He is All-Aware of all things, and He encompasses all things, without any likening, delimiting, or similitude.",

Allah said: They await nothing but a single cry which seizes them while they are disputing, meaning they wait and do not expect sight with eyes. And similar verses from the Quran. The verification of this in the language is the statement of one: I am but looking to Allah then to you, meaning he waits for what comes to him from Allah's direction. As for sight, it can occur without eyes. Allah said: Did you not look unto your Lord how He extended the shadow? And: Did you not look at the one who argued with Abraham about his Lord? And: Did you not look at those who went forth from their dwellings? And: Did not man look that We created him from a drop? And: You desired death before you met it, then you saw it while you were looking. This all and its like means knowledge and certainty, not sight of the eyes. The verification of this in Arabic language is when one says: I saw for such a one action and piety and understanding and knowledge and I saw for him manners and recognition, and these things are not directly observed with sight but known and understood by what appears of their signs pointing to them.",
