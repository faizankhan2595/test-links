One group stands opposite the enemy and takes their weapons, and he prays with the group that is with him one rak'ah and two prostrations. When the leader raises his head from the second prostration, they should position themselves behind them, and another group who have not yet prayed should come to pray with him. The first group retreats and takes the position of their companions. He then prays with the second group one rak'ah and two prostrations, then gives the salam. The two groups then stand, the first group completes one rak'ah and two prostrations then gives salam. They then stand at the position of their companions, and those who were opposite the enemy come forward and pray one rak'ah and two prostrations and give salam",
