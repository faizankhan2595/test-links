The equivalent of commanding the right is calling to Allah in the dominion of the disbelievers, and the equivalent of forbidding the wrong is jihad in the path of Allah. By Allah, a journey in the path of Allah, whether early morning or evening, is better than the whole world and all that is in it.",
