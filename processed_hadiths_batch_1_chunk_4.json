      "english_translation": "Ibn Abbas associated as partners those who went to the idea that predestination is other than kingdom/power because of His saying: Glorified and Exalted is He above what they associate with Him, and He said: And Allah compresses and expands, meaning He gives and withholds. And He said in the verse of the shade: Then We drew it back to Us with easy drawing. And the Arabs said: Allah compressed so-and-so unto Him meaning in mercy. And they say: So-and-so took possession of his house and his land, meaning he seized them and withheld them. And they say: So-and-so is only in my grasp meaning in my power over him. And they say: Creation is turning over in the grasp of Allah.",

      "english_translation": "And His saying Allah's hand and the forelocks in His hand, they mean by this His kingdom and power, and they do not mean by this what the Jews meant because the statement of the Jews is association on their meaning and the statement of the Muslims is truth on their meaning differing from the meaning of the Jews. Rather they mean kingdom and power while the Jews intended similitude and delimitation. And it is like the saying of Allah: Blessed is the One in Whose hand is the kingdom, meaning to Him alone not to another, and it does not mean that He is grasping it as a man places something in his hand. And the verification of that is the statement of the Arabs: We are under the hand of so-and-so, and our affairs are in the hand of so-and-so, and our affairs are in the hand of Allah, and our needs are in the hand of Allah. And Allah said: Or he who has in his hand the knot of marriage, and rather by all of this in the Quran and language is kingdom and power.",
