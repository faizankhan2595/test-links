And if you remember Me in a gathering, I will remember you in a gathering better than it. And if you draw near to Me by a hand's span, I will draw near to you by an arm's length. And if you draw near to Me by an arm's length, I will draw near to you by a fathom's length. And if you come to Me walking, I will come to you running.'
