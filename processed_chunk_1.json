He said: I heard him saying: The plague is a torment sent upon a faction from the Children of Israel, or upon those who were before you. So if you hear about it in a land, do not enter it. And if it befalls a land and you are in it, do not exit fleeing from it.",

When he reached Sargh, a place in al-Sham, the commanders of the armies met him: Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, may Allah be pleased with him, with his companions, and they informed him that plague had befallen the land of al-Sham. They differed - some said: You went out for a mission and we do not think you should return from it. And some said: With you are the remnant of the people and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and we do not think you should expose them to this plague. Umar said: Leave me. Ibn Abbas said: Umar said: Call for me the first emigrants. So they called them, and he consulted them and they differed. Some said: With you are the remnant of the people and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and we do not think you should expose them to this plague. And some said: You went out for a mission and we do not think you should return from it. He said: Leave me. They left. Ibn Abbas said: Then he said: Call for me the Ansar. So they called them, and he consulted them and they followed the way of the emigrants and differed as they differed. He said: Leave me. They left. Then he said: Call for me whoever is here from the elders of Quraysh and from the emigrants of the conquest. So he called them, and there was no disagreement between them - two men did not dispute - and they said: We think you should return with the people and not expose them to this plague. So Umar called out to the people: I am departing in the morning, so depart in the morning. Abu Ubaidah said: Is this fleeing from the decree of Allah, O Umar? Umar said: If someone other than you said it, O Abu Ubaidah! Yes, we flee from the decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. Ibn Abbas said: Then Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf came, and he was absent attending to some of his needs. He said: I have knowledge about this. I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying: When you hear about it in a land, do not advance upon it. And if it befalls a land and you are in it, do not exit fleeing from it. He said: Umar praised Allah and thanked Him, then left.",
