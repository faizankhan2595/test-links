Muhammad ibn Sa'd and others agreed that he died in the year ninety-six during the caliphate of al-Walid ibn Abd al-Malik in Kufa, at the age of forty-nine, not having completed fifty. It was conveyed to me that Yahya ibn Said al-Qattan said: Abraham died at nearly fifty-five years old. Abu Nu'aym said: I asked the grandson of Abraham about his death, and he said: Four or five months after al-Hajjaj. Abu Nu'aym said: It seems he died at the beginning of the year ninety-six.",
