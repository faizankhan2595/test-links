Father presented the people and had marked on each man's name what he was absent. He kept striking them until he called Ibrahim. He was absent twenty days beyond the deadline. He ordered regarding him, and we stood up to him, and we were ten brothers. He said to us: \"Whoever's mother is a free woman, then she is divorced, and whoever's mother is a slave woman, then she is free, if you do not sit down and do not speak, until I carry out my order regarding him as I have carried it out regarding others.\" So we sat until he struck him twenty stripes.",
