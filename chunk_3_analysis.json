    "english_translation": "Narrated from Zayd ibn Aslaim: A man from the Ansar was sheltering under a Sarahah tree (Acacia tree). Umar passed by and said: 'Do you know why the shade of the Sarahah is beloved?' He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'Why?' He said: 'Because its shade is cool and it has no thorns.' He said: 'And for something else. Do you see, when you are between the two mountain passes (al-Ma'zamayn) below Mina, from that place to the sunrise there is the place of As-Surar, or he said: the mosque of As-Surar. Seventy prophets were granted their prayers in it. One of the prophets sheltered under a Sarahah tree, made supplication and it was answered for him, and he made supplication for it and it was protected as you see it now. It does not decay as sorcery decays.' Ma'mar said: 'Surru' (they were granted): their tombs were cut off. La ya'tallu (does not decay): meaning it does not become hollow from beneath ever.'",
