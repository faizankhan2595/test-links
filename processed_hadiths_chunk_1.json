He said: 'This is the grave of Abu Righal,' they said: 'And who is Abu Righal?' He said: 'A man who was from Thamud, he was in the sanctuary of Allah, so the sanctuary of Allah prevented the punishment of Allah from reaching him. When he left (the sanctuary), he was afflicted with what befell his people. He was buried here, and with him was buried a branch of gold. The people rushed to it and dug for it until they extracted the branch.'",

One day he said to his son: 'I am troubled, if only you would bring some men to talk to me.' So his son gathered a group of men and said: 'Enter and speak with him. If you hear something reprehensible from him, forgive him, for he is old. If you hear something good from him, accept it.' They entered and the first thing he said was: 'Is not the most clever of the clever the one who has piety? And verily the most foolish of the foolish is the one who commits immorality. When one of you marries, let him marry from a good family. And when you perceive from a man a vice, beware of it, for it has companions.'",
