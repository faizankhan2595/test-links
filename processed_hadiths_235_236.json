I forbade you from fermentation in gourds, hollowed wood, watered skins, and jars, for a vessel does not make something permissible or impermissible, but avoid intoxicants. I forbade you from visiting graves because the disbelievers would go to them and cling to them, sacrificing near them and speaking foolishness. So do not do as they do, but there is no harm in visiting them, for in visiting them is an admonishment as long as you do not speak foolishness.",

He said: O Messenger of Allah, it is a gift. When the rabbit was presented to the Prophet ﷺ, he looked at it and saw blood in it. The Prophet ﷺ then asked the people: Do you not see what I see? They replied: Yes, O Messenger of Allah, there is a trace of blood. The Prophet ﷺ said: It is for you. The people asked: Will you not eat it, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Yes. He left it out of disgust. The people then ate it. The shepherd asked: O Messenger of Allah, what do you think about eating the monitor lizard? The Prophet ﷺ said: We do not eat, and we do not give as gifts what we do not eat. The shepherd said: O Messenger of Allah, I am herding my family's sheep and I am afraid the wild animal might escape me and I do not have a knife. Can I slaughter with my tooth? He said: No. With my claw? He said: No. With a bone? He said: No. With a stick? He said: No. The shepherd asked: Then with what, O Messenger of Allah? The Prophet ﷺ said: With a flint stone, striking one against the other. If you make a cut, eat. If you do not make a cut, do not eat. The shepherd said: O Messenger of Allah, I shoot with an arrow and sometimes hit (clearly killing) and sometimes miss (wounding only). The Prophet ﷺ said: What you clearly kill, eat. What you only wound, do not eat. Abu Khalid explained that Zayd ibn Ali clarified that 'what clearly kills' means what you see with your own eyes, and 'what only wounds' means what escapes your sight, perhaps another arrow helped kill it.",

And Zayd ibn Ali said: Game from untrained dogs, leopards, hawks, and falcons is not eaten except what you catch it alive, because Allah said: Eat of what they catch for you. So Allah has only made lawful what you have trained of birds of prey. Training a dog and leopard is that they do not eat, and training a hawk and falcon is that they respond when called.",
