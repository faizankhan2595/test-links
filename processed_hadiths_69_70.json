The Prophet ﷺ said: 'Do not let any man be angry if I took other than him, indeed Gabriel is pointing them out to me one by one.' So he took from Banu Salamah: al-Bara ibn Ma'rur and Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Haram, and from Banu Awf ibn al-Khazraj: Ubadah ibn al-Samit, and from Banu al-Harith ibn al-Khazraj: Abdullah ibn Rawahah and Sa'd ibn al-Rabi', and from Banu Sa'idah: Sa'd ibn Ubadah and al-Mundhir ibn Amr, and from Banu al-Najjar: Abu Umamah Asad ibn Zarurah, and from Banu Zurayq: Rafi ibn Malik, and from al-Aws from Banu Abdu al-Ashal: Abu al-Haytham ibn al-Tayhan and Usayd ibn Hudhair, and from Banu Amr ibn Awf: Sa'd ibn Khaythamah.",
