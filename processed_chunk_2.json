It was also reported that the reason for Ibrahim al-Taymi's imprisonment was that al-Hajjaj was seeking Ibrahim al-Nakh'ai. The officer came and said: I want Ibrahim. Ibrahim al-Taymi said: I am Ibrahim, so he took him even though he knew he was seeking Ibrahim al-Nakh'ai. Ibrahim al-Taymi would not guide him to al-Nakh'ai, so he brought him to al-Hajjaj who ordered him imprisoned in the Dimasa (prison). They had no shade from the sun nor shelter from the cold, and every two were in a chain. Ibrahim changed (in appearance). His mother came to visit him in prison but did not recognize him until he spoke. He died in prison. Al-Hajjaj saw in his dream someone saying: A man from the people of Paradise died in this city tonight. When morning came, al-Hajjaj asked: Did anyone die last night in Wasit? They said: Yes, Ibrahim al-Taymi died in prison. He said: It is a dream, a suggestion from Satan, and ordered him thrown on the garbage heap.",
