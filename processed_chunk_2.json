    "english_translation": "Narrated by Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): He said: 'When you enter a city and have decided to stay for ten days, then complete (the full prayer)'. Zaid ibn Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) also said: 'Do not shorten the prayer except for a journey of three days. When you leave your house intending to travel for three days or more, shorten when you pass beyond the houses of your people and city'. Also narrated: The Prophet ﷺ prayed two rak'ahs and two rak'ahs in Makkah until he returned. Also narrated: The Prophet ﷺ used to perform optional prayer on his camel during his travel, wherever his camel turned, making signs with his head, making his prostration lower than his bowing. He did not perform obligatory prayers or Witr except when he alighted. Zaid ibn Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) also said: When a resident enters the prayer of a traveler and the traveler says the greeting, the resident stands and completes (the full prayer). When a traveler enters the prayer of a resident, he prays with his (the resident's) prayer'",

    "english_translation": "Narrated by Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): He said: 'The obligatory prostrations in the Quran are four: Alif Lam Meem (Chapter 2), and Ha Meem (Chapter 41), and An-Najm (Chapter 53), and Iqra' bismi rabbika alladi khalaq (Chapter 96). He also said: As for the rest of what is in the Quran, if you wish you may prostrate and if you wish you may leave it'. He was asked about a man who reads a prostration verse multiple times in a gathering. He said: One prostration suffices him. Zaid ibn Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) also said: If the prostration is at the end of the chapter, incorporate it in the ruku (bowing), and if it is in the middle of the chapter, there is no escaping from prostrating. He was asked about a man who hears the prostration verse from a dhimmi (non-Muslim under covenant), or a woman, or a child. He said: He prostrates'",
