He said to her: 'Glorify Allah one hundred times, for it is better than freeing one hundred slaves. Praise Allah one hundred times, for it is better than giving one hundred horses for the sake of Allah. Magnify Allah one hundred times, for it is better than giving one hundred sacrificial camels to the House of Allah. And say: There is no god except Allah, alone without partner, to Him belongs the sovereignty and to Him is the praise and He is able to do all things, one hundred times, for it is better than what is between the heavens and the earth. And no deed shall be raised for anyone more excellent than this, except for one who says like what you said or adds more.'",
