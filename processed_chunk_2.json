They recite the Quran but it does not go beyond their throats. They pass through the religion like an arrow passes through the hunted animal. You look at the arrowhead and see nothing. Then you look at the arrow shaft and see nothing. Then you look at the feathers and see nothing, and you doubt about the nocking point of the arrow. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said this hadith about the Khawarij (those who rebel against the true religion). The Rabi' said: The arrowhead is the iron tip, the arrow shaft is the arrow which has the iron tip, the arrow feathers are what the bowstring is placed upon. It is also narrated: You look at the reddish part and see nothing, and the reddish part is the head of the arrow.",
