I entered upon them and said: O father, how do you find yourself? And O Bilal, how do you find yourself? Abu Bakr, when fever seized him, would say: Every man is with his family in the morning, and death is nearer than the strap of his sandal. And Bilal, when the fever abated, would raise his voice and say: Oh would that I knew - shall I spend a night in a wadi with idhkir and jalil around me? And shall I come upon the waters of Majannah? And shall Shama and Tafil appear before me? Aisha said: So I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and informed him, and he said: O Allah, make Madinah beloved to us as we love Makkah, cure it, bless us in its sa and mudd, and remove its fever and place it in al-Juhfah. Al-Rabi said: al-Jalil is a plant. al-Aqirah is the voice. Shama and Tafil are two mountains overlooking Majannah. Majannah is a market at the bottom of Makkah at the distance of a bridle. Abu Ubaidah, from Jabir ibn Zayd, said: I heard Jabir ibn Abdullah saying: A Bedouin pledged allegiance to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and the Bedouin was seized with malaise. The hadith. Al-Rabi from Ubadah ibn as-Samit said: Indeed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was treated by Gabriel while he had malaise. The hadith.",
