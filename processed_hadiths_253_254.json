You are the soldiers of Allah. You fight those who disbelieve in Allah. Call them to the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and to affirm what Muhammad brought from Allah. If they believe, then they are your brothers in faith. They have what you have and upon them is what is upon you. If they refuse, then wage war against them and seek Allah's help against them. If Allah grants you victory over them, do not kill children, nor women, nor an old man who cannot fight against you, nor destroy any water spring, nor cut down trees except those that harm you. Do not mutilate any human being or animal. Do not oppress or transgress. Any man among you, whether from the furthest or nearest, whether free or slave, who gives safe conduct to any of them or gestures to them with his hand, and they come based on his gesture, then he has safe conduct until he hears the word of Allah, which is the Book of Allah. If he accepts, then he is your brother in your religion. If he refuses, then return him to his place of safety and seek Allah's help against him. Do not give them my covenant or Allah's covenant. Whoever violates Allah's covenant will meet Allah and He is angry with him. Give them your covenant and the covenants of your fathers and their allies. For truly, any one of you to preserve his own covenant and his father's covenant is better for him than to violate Allah's covenant and His Messenger's covenant.",

The equivalent of commanding the right is calling to Allah in the dominion of the disbelievers, and the equivalent of forbidding the wrong is jihad in the path of Allah.

The second grade is that a wife from the houris of Paradise appears to him and says: Rejoice, O friend of Allah, by Allah there is nothing with Allah better for you than what is with your family. The third grade is that when his soul departs, his servants from Paradise come and wash him, wrap him in a shroud, and perfume him with the perfume of Paradise. The fourth grade is that no Muslim's soul exits with more ease than the martyr's. The fifth grade is that he will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment and his wounds emanate musk, and the martyrs will be recognized by their fragrance on the Day of Judgment. The sixth grade is that none are closer in residence to the Throne of the Merciful than the martyrs. The seventh grade is that every Friday they visit Allah, Most Mighty and Majestic, are greeted with greetings of honor, and are presented with the gifts of Paradise, then they depart, and it is said: These are the visitors of the Merciful.",

He also said: I heard Zaid ibn Ali saying: When the Imam overcomes a land and decides to show mercy to its people, he imposes the land tax on their heads. But if he decides to divide it, he makes it land of tithe. He also said: I asked Zaid ibn Ali about property that polytheists overcame and then the Muslims later overcame it. He said: If its owner comes and recognizes it before the division of spoils, he takes it without charge. But if he comes after the division, he takes it for its price. If the people of war embrace Islam while it is still in their hands, then it is theirs and he has no claim over them.",
