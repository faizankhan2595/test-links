      "english_translation": "Narrated by Jabir ibn Zayd: Ibn Abbas was asked about the saying of Allah: Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. Ibn Abbas, al-Hasan, Qatadah, Amr ibn Muhammad, Abu Muslim al-Makki, and Mujahid said: Allah is the justice of the heavens and the earth, and He is the Guide of those in the heavens and the earth. Like His saying: The example of His light, and there is no example for Him, rather He means the example of His justice. As for His saying: Except that Allah comes to them in clouds from the cloud and the angels, al-Kalbi narrated from Abu Salih saying: He comes to them with His command and judgment to separate between them. And this is the statement of al-Hasan and Mujahid. And likewise His saying: And your Lord came, meaning: with His command and judgment. Ibn Abbas, al-Hasan, Abu Salih, and Amr said: And the meaning of your Lord came means: And the command of your Lord came, meaning His judgment. And Allah said: And indeed We came to them with the Book, meaning: The messengers came to them. And the evidence for that is the saying of Allah in another verse: Do they await except that the angels come to them or that the command of your Lord comes? And Hushaym was asked about that, so he said: They used to say: And the command of your Lord came, meaning His judgment. And He said: Have they not seen that We come to the earth reducing it from its extremities? And He said: So Allah came to their building from the foundations. And He said: So Allah came to them from where they had not reckoned.",
