    "english_translation": "Narrated by Ali: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: The martyr has seven grades. The first grade is that he sees his place in Paradise before his soul exits his body, which eases what he is suffering. The second grade is that a wife from the houris of Paradise appears to him and says: Rejoice, O friend of Allah, by Allah there is nothing with Allah better for you than what is with your family. The third grade is that when his soul departs, his servants from Paradise come and wash him, wrap him in a shroud, and perfume him with the perfume of Paradise. The fourth grade is that no Muslim's soul exits with more ease than the martyr's. The fifth grade is that he will be resurrected on the Day of Judgment and his wounds emanate musk, and the martyrs will be recognized by their fragrance on the Day of Judgment. The sixth grade is that none are closer in residence to the Throne of the Merciful than the martyrs. The seventh grade is that every Friday they visit Allah, Most Mighty and Majestic, are greeted with greetings of honor, and are presented with the gifts of Paradise, then they depart, and it is said: These are the visitors of the Merciful.",

But if he decides to divide it, he makes it land of tithe. He also said: I asked Zaid ibn Ali about property that polytheists overcame and then the Muslims later overcame it. He said: If its owner comes and recognizes it before the division of spoils, he takes it without charge. But if he comes after the division, he takes it for its price. If the people of war embrace Islam while it is still in their hands, then it is theirs and he has no claim over them.",
