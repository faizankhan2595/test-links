I said: Something confused me in my prayer until I did not know what I was praying. He said: That is the Devil. Come closer. I came closer and sat on the balls of my feet before him. He said: Open your mouth. He struck my chest with his hand and said: Go about your work. Uthman said: I do not think the Devil disturbed me after that.

Also narrated through another chain: Mutarrif ibn Abdullah came to Uthman ibn Abi al-As and asked permission. He sat at the door. Then he was allowed in. Uthman said: An hour for this world and an hour for the Hereafter, and Allah the Exalted knows which of the two will predominate over us. Mutarrif said: You have taken both this world and the Hereafter. He said: The dirham obtained by one of you from his labor, which he spends in righteous ways, is better than ten thousand dirhams which one of us obtains from excess in abundance. Also through another chain: A slave of Uthman ibn Abi al-As asked him to give him money to trade with, with profits shared between them. He gave him twenty thousand. The slave bought wine with it. Then he came with it to al-Ubulla. Uthman came out to meet him and did not leave a container without breaking it.",
