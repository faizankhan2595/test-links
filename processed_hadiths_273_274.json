He said: My people claim that. I said: I hoped to meet you. He said: You have met me. I said: I am a man who is away from water and with me is my family. He said: Do you know Abu Dharr? I became discontented with Madinah so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered me with camels and ordered me to drink from their urine and milk. Hammad said: Then Ayyub used to say milk and would not mention urine. So I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and he was sitting among the pillars of the mosque. He said: O Abu Dharr. I said: I am in a state of major ritual impurity, O Messenger of Allah. So he called for water and a black slave girl came with it in a container that sloshed. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered a man from his companions to screen me, so I screened myself with the camel and washed. Then I came to him. He said: O Abu Dharr, the earth is sufficient for you even for ten pilgrimages. When you find water then let it touch your skin or your skin.",

He said: Your heart becomes submissive to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and the Muslims become safe from your tongue and your hand. He said: Which Islam is best? He said: Faith. He said: And what is faith? He said: You believe in Allah, Mighty and Majestic, and His angels, and His books, and in the resurrection after death. He said: Which faith is best? He said: Emigration. He said: And what is emigration? He said: That you abandon evil. He said: Which emigration is best? He said: Jihad. He said: And what is jihad? He said: That you fight the disbelievers when you encounter them. Then two deeds are from the best of deeds except for one who does the like of them, saying it three times: A pilgrimage that is accepted or an Umrah.\nChain 2: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to wipe over the socks and the head-cover.",

I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: There is no Muslim who calls for ablution and washes his face except that his sins fall away from his face from the edges of his beard. If he washes his hand, his sins fall away from his hand from between his nails and fingertips. If he wipes his head, his sins fall away from his head from the edges of his hair. If he washes his feet, his sins fall away from his feet from the soles of his feet. If he prays in congregation, his reward falls upon Allah. If he prays two units of prayer with sincerity of heart to Allah, Mighty and Majestic, they are his atonement. Ayyub said: I said to Abu Qilabah: Two units? He said: Do you not see that he says: Then he makes sincere in them his heart to Allah, Mighty and Majestic?",

Then she disputed over the inheritance with Uthman ibn Affan.
