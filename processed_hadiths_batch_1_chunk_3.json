You are the soldiers of Allah. You fight those who disbelieve in Allah. Call them to the testimony that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and to affirm what Muhammad brought from Allah. If they believe, then they are your brothers in faith. They have what you have and upon them is what is upon you. If they refuse, then wage war against them and seek Allah's help against them. If Allah grants you victory over them, do not kill children, nor women, nor an old man who cannot fight against you, nor destroy any water spring, nor cut down trees except those that harm you. Do not mutilate any human being or animal. Do not oppress or transgress. Any man among you, whether from the furthest or nearest, whether free or slave, who gives safe conduct to any of them or gestures to them with his hand, and they come based on his gesture, then he has safe conduct until he hears the word of Allah, which is the Book of Allah. If he accepts, then he is your brother in your religion. If he refuses, then return him to his place of safety and seek Allah's help against him. Do not give them my covenant or Allah's covenant. Whoever violates Allah's covenant will meet Allah and He is angry with him. Give them your covenant and the covenants of your fathers and their allies. For truly, any one of you to preserve his own covenant and his father's covenant is better for him than to violate Allah's covenant and His Messenger's covenant.",
