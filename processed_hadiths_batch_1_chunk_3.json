Jabir said: Ibn Abbas and al-Hasan al-Basri said: The goodness in good deed, and the increase in ninefold, as Allah said: Whoever brings a good deed shall have better than it, thus he has ten times its like. Mujahid said: Its like is the goodness, and the increase, he said: forgiveness and pleasure. Al-Sha'bi said: The increase is entry into Paradise. Muhammad ibn Ka'b said: The increase that Allah increases them from honor and reward. Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Layla said: They did good meaning they united Allah. The goodness is Paradise. And the increase is what Allah increases them from His bounty and mercy. Abu Hazim al-Madini said: The increase is the blessings of Allah that He bestowed upon them, He gave it to them, did not hold them accountable for it, and did not treat them as He treated others, but showered them with blessings.",

He said: The Jews who were enemies of Allah came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Muhammad, describe your Lord to us. The Prophet ﷺ trembled and said: How can I describe my Lord who created the heavens and the earth? They said: If you were a prophet you would describe Him. Then they said: Is He like this and like that? So Allah sent down refutation of their statement: And they did not value Allah with the value due to Him, meaning they did not glorify Allah with the glorification due to Him. And the earth entirely will be in His grasp meaning in His power. And the heavens are folded in His right hand meaning in His kingdom. How can these wicked ones describe me when they have not seen my heavens nor my earth? Then He glorified Himself saying: Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate with Him, because the description that came from them was association with partners. Ibn Abbas said: Whoever claims that Allah has a little finger or thumb has indeed associated partners, because Allah is not like anything, and if it were as the Jews said, He would not have said: Glorified and Exalted is He far above what they associate. But they described Him with attributes other than His attributes, so He glorified Himself from what they say. And they said: The saying of Allah: And they did not value Allah with the value due to Him, meaning they did not glorify Allah with glorification due to Him when they said: The earth entirely will be in His grasp and they meant the fingers. And they did not value Allah with the value due to Him when they said: The heavens are folded in His right hand as they mentioned, with delimitation and similitude. Allah said: Glorified, so He glorified Himself from what they say and associate.",
