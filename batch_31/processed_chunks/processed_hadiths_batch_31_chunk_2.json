They mentioned it to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He said: Leave it alone until its owner comes. So the Bahzi man came as its owner. He said: O Messenger of Allah, what is (the matter) with you regarding this? Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, stood and distributed it among the companions while they were in a state of ihram (sacred consecration), until when they were at al-Ithaba', behold, a gazelle resting in the shade of a tree with an arrow in it. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded a man to stand by it until he informs the people about it.",
