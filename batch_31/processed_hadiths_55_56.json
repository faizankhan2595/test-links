When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ finished, he said: O assembly of Muslims, indeed there is no prayer for one who does not keep his back straight in bowing and prostration. And he saw a man praying alone behind the row, and the Prophet of Allah ﷺ stood over him when he finished and said: Straighten your prayer, for there is no prayer for one who prays behind the row alone.",

He took with him a mad son or nephew. Al-Ash'ath said to him: O Zari, you have come as a delegation to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and you have brought with you a mad man. He said: As for the mad man, I am going to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ so that perhaps he will pray to Allah to heal him or pray to Allah for his healing. When we arrived in Madinah, we were told: This is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and we could not control ourselves but we jumped from our beasts and began kissing his hands and feet. As for al-Ash'ath, he untied his beast and tied it up, threw off his travel clothes, and took out two beautiful garments as if they were in a container and put them on. All this was before the eyes of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Then he came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: O Ash'ath, you have two qualities that Allah Mighty and Majestic loves and His Messenger loves. He said: What are they? He said: Forbearance and patience. He said: O Messenger of Allah, are these two qualities that I have acquired or has Allah Mighty and Majestic created me upon them? He said: Rather, Allah Mighty and Majestic has created you upon them. He said: Praise be to Allah who has created me upon two qualities that Allah Mighty and Majestic loves and His Messenger loves. My grandfather said: O Messenger of Allah, I have with me a nephew of mine who is mad, I have come to you to pray to Allah for him. He said: Bring him to me. I went to him while he was with the caravan, released him, threw off his travel clothes, and dressed him in two beautiful garments. I took his hand until I reached the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He said: Bring him near to me. And he was looking like a mad person. He said: Bring him near to me and place his back toward me. He took hold of the edges of his garment from top and bottom and began striking his back until I saw the whiteness of his armpit, saying: Go out, enemy of Allah, go out, enemy of Allah. He began looking with the look of a healthy person, not like his first look. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ seated him before him and called for water and wiped his face and prayed for him. After the Prophet's ﷺ prayer, no one in the caravan was superior to him. My grandfather said: Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ prayed for us saying: O Allah, forgive Abd al-Qais when they submitted willingly, not forced, not humiliated and not defeated, when a people refused to submit until they were defeated and captured. He did not stop praying for us until the sun declined. I said: O Messenger of Allah, we have a nephew. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: The nephew of the people is from them or from themselves. When we returned, al-Ash'ath said: O Zari, you had better judgment than me.",

Warr ibn Musharrah said: They were older than me so they testified, then he testified that he is the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and that Musaylimah would be after him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ turned to me and said: With what do you testify, O boy? I said: I testify with what you testified to and I deny what you denied. He said: I testify by the number of soil of al-Dahna and soil of Yathrib that Musaylimah is a liar. Warr said: I testified with what you testified to. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Seize them. They were seized and taken to a house to be imprisoned. A man said: Give them to me, O Messenger of Allah. He did so and they left. Warr ibn Musharrah stayed with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ learning the Quran until the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died, and his companions returned. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ died, Warr came and stayed with his mother in Arqaba. Musaylimah heard of him and sent to him. He said: May Allah not let me walk to him ever. He sent to him then: I will make you bleed in your mother's lap. He refused. He turned away from him until Khalid ibn al-Walid came and fought him, and he fought with him, and Musaylimah was killed.",
