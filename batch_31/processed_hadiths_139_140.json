He did not wash them nor did he pray over them as he prays over the dead, nor did he shroud them in other than their garments. He would command that two men be buried in one grave, and he would say: 'Which of these took more of the Quran?'

We found that we had camped at the well of Thamud or the well of Hijr, and we had drawn water and kneaded dough. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ ordered us to pour out the water and discard the dough and to depart. I had prepared a hasah (mixture of dates, butter and dried yogurt) for myself, so I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, shall I feed it to my riding camel?' He said: 'Feed it to her.' So we poured out the water, discarded the dough, and departed until we camped at the well of Salih.",

The Balawi said: 'By Allah, I would not be worthy if I did not give the Messenger of Allah ﷺ the best of my wealth - you shall be given the best of it, two camels.' So he took from him two she-camels of similar age. When he came with them to the Prophet ﷺ, he disapproved of them and said: 'What are these?' He said: 'I took them from a man who said such and such,' describing what was mentioned. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'Give them back to the Azd if they come to us.' So he (the Balawi) came to the Prophet ﷺ and pledged allegiance to him. The Prophet ﷺ said: 'No time will pass upon people except that it is better than what comes after it until the Hour is established. And among what he said: If you intend a matter, then you must be deliberate until Allah shows you a way out from it.'",
