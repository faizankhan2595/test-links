    "english_translation": "Narrated by Qais ibn Abbad: I used to visit Madinah during the caliphate of Umar, and I would meet companions of the Prophet ﷺ. Among them, the most beloved to me to meet was Ubayy ibn Ka'b. When the prayer was called, Umar came one day with men, and I was in the row. A man from them looked at the faces of the people as if he recognized them except me. He removed me and stood in my place, so I did not understand my prayer. When we finished the prayer, he said: Young man, do not grieve that I did not do what I did out of ignorance, but the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Be in the first row that is next to me. Then he sat and narrated hadith such that I never saw men stretching their necks towards a man facing them like that.",
