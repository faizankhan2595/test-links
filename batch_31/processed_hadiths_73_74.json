He said: It seems we are being called upon, young and old. My sons, prepare me. They said: O father, you have already fought with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and with Abu Bakr and Umar, so we shall fight for you. He refused, so they prepared him and he went out to sea, and he died in the sea. They did not find an island to bury him in for seven days, and he did not decompose.",

On the third day, he commanded his camel to be saddled and mounted it, then walked until he stood at the edge of the well and called out to them: O so-and-so son of so-and-so, would it please you that you had obeyed Allah and His Messenger? Verily we have found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true? Umar said: O Messenger of Allah, are you speaking to bodies without souls?
