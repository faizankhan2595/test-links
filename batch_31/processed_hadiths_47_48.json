Bishr was negligent, so Umar met him and said: 'Do we not have hearing and obedience from you?' He said: 'Yes, but I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying: \"Whoever is placed in charge of any of the affairs of the Muslims and does not undertake it with sincerity will be brought on the Day of Resurrection hanging over the Bridge of Jahannam, and if he was good he will be saved, and if he was evil he will fall through it for seventy years.\"' Then Umar left grieving and sad, and Abu Dharr met him and said: 'Why do I see you grieving and sad?' He said: 'What prevents me from being grieving and sad when I heard Bishr ibn Asim say: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying: \"Whoever is placed in charge of any of the people...\" [similar wording]' Abu Dharr said: 'Did you hear it from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?' He said: 'No.' Abu Dharr said: 'I testify that I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying: \"Whoever is placed in charge of any of the people will be brought on the Day of Resurrection until he is made to stand over the Bridge of Jahannam...\"'",

The Prophet ﷺ recognized that army when Tariq ibn al-Muarraqa' said: 'Who will give me a spear in exchange for the reward thereof?' I said: 'What is its reward?' He said: 'The first daughter born to me I shall marry to him.' I gave him my spear and then I forgot about it for years until I was told that a daughter was born to him and had reached maturity. I said: 'Send her to me,' but he refused unless I gave him a dowry. The Prophet ﷺ asked: 'Which of the women is she?' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, she has reached her teens.' He said: 'It is better for you that you do not sin and do not burden your companion with sin.'",
