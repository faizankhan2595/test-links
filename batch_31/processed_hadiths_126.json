So the Prophet ﷺ asked Abyadh ibn Hammal to reconsider the grant. Abyadh said: I will reconsider it on the condition that you make it charity. The Prophet ﷺ said: It is charity from you. And it is like flowing water, and whoever comes to it may take from it. And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave him land and water in al-Goufa, Jarf Murad, when he reconsidered it.
