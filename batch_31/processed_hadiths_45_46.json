So he wrote to him: 'Indeed the Messenger of Allah ﷺ used to say after his prayers: There is no god but Allah, alone, without partner. For Him is the dominion and to Him is the praise, and He is capable of all things. O Allah, there is no preventer of what You give and no giver of what You prevent, and no benefit for the possessor of wealth from his wealth except from You.'",
