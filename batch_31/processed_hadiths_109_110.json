They went with that letter to that tribe, he presented it to them and read it to them, but they denied it and did not accept it, and they killed one of the two men or one of the messengers—there is doubt from Abu Jamrah. Then the Prophet ﷺ said: 'Indeed, if I had sent this letter of mine to a people at the coast from the people of Oman from this clan of Azd, they would have confirmed me and accepted my letter.' Then a man from the Ansar, called Ka'b ibn Ujrah, sprang up and said: 'With my father and mother be your ransom O Messenger of Allah, what prevents you from writing to our brothers? By Allah, if they were in the pre-Islamic period the strongest of us as men, the most capable in carrying, and the farthest in reaching. They settled at the shore of the sea and controlled the sea. Were it not that the land is distant, they would have come as their brothers from the Shanua came. So the Prophet ﷺ wrote to them a letter and sent a man from the Ansar. Then a man from Abdul-Qais sprang up and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, send me with them as I will guide the way and know it.' So he wrote a letter and addressed it to their king Ibn Jalanda and the people of Yemen, and said to the two messengers: 'Indeed, he will accept my letter and believe me, both he and the people of Oman will believe in me. And Ibn Jalanda will ask you: Did the Messenger of Allah ﷺ send with you a gift? Say no. And he will say: Indeed, if he had sent with you a gift it would have been like the table that was sent down upon the Messiah for the Children of Israel. When they came to him they accepted Islam and his king accepted Islam and they believed in the Prophet ﷺ, and his king sent to the Prophet ﷺ a gift and sent with them from the charity of his wealth. The people of Oman accepted Islam and sent the charity of their wealth. They sent a delegation of ten, among them Abu Sufrah and Abu al-Mahaliba, and he sent a man from the offspring of a king called Ka'b ibn Shawr, and the rest of the delegation from the offspring of Jalanda and from the offspring of a king. They came to Madinah and the Prophet ﷺ had been taken (died) and Abu Bakr was made the Caliph, so the gift was given to Abu Bakr, then Ali ibn Abi Talib sprang up and said: 'This is the gift of Ibn Jalanda to the Prophet ﷺ, this is not Fadak.' Ibn Abbas said: 'So I do not know whether he divided it or put it in the treasury with the charity. Ibn Abbas said: If he divided it, we would have known that. For al-Abbas it would have been half of it and for Fatimah it would have been half of it.'",
