I asked my Lord that He would not afflict you with a punishment that He inflicted upon those before you, and He granted me that. And I asked Him that He would not place over you an enemy who would ravage your homeland, and He granted me that. And I asked Him that He would not cause you to be divided into sects and make some of you taste the punishment of others, and He withheld that from me. Abu Malik said: So I asked him (Nafi'): Did your father hear this from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ?

We rode after him and drove a portion of our charities (Zakat) and expenditures which they were carrying. He arrived before them and came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of Allah, I came to a people in their state of ignorance and they were strong in fighting and refused to give the charity. The Prophet ﷺ did not change (his decision) regarding that until the revelation came to him: O you who have believed, if there comes to you a fasiq (immoral person) with information, verify it (Surah al-Hujurat 49:6). And the Mustaliq (tribe) came to the Prophet ﷺ following al-Walid with a portion of their obligatory contributions (Fara'id) which they were driving, and they mentioned that to him and that they went out seeking al-Walid for their charity but did not find him. He said: So they raised to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ what was with them and said: O Messenger of Allah, we received the news of your messenger's departure and we were pleased with that, and we said: We will meet him. But we received news of his return and we feared that might be a displeasure against us. And they offered to the Prophet ﷺ that he buy from them what remained. So he accepted from them the obligatory portions (Fara'id) and said: Return with your expenditures, for we do not sell anything from the charity until we take possession of it. So they returned to their families, and he sent to them one who took the rest of their charity.",
