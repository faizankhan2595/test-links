He said: I am not more afraid for you because of the Dajjal when he appears among you, than I am afraid right now because of what I fear for you in this year. He said: If the Dajjal comes forth while I am among you, I will be the one to contend with him on your behalf. But if he comes forth after I am gone, each man is a guardian over himself. With regard to those of my nation who live after me, I enjoin them to follow the Caliph and those who will be in authority after me.",
