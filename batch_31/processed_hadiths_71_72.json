Among them, the most beloved to me to meet was Ubayy ibn Ka'b. When the prayer was called, Umar came one day with men, and I was in the row. A man from them looked at the faces of the people as if he recognized them except me. He removed me and stood in my place, so I did not understand my prayer. When we finished the prayer, he said: Young man, do not grieve that I did not do what I did out of ignorance, but the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Be in the first row that is next to me. Then he sat and narrated hadith such that I never saw men stretching their necks towards a man facing them like that.",
