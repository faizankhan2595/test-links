Shu'bah doubted about spreading the greeting, though he mentioned it. He said: I cannot do that. He said: Do you have camels? He said: Yes.

He said: The Prophet ﷺ forbade us from drinking on our bellies, which is lapping (kara'), and commanded us to scoop water with the hand. He said: Let none of you lap like a dog does, and let none drink with one hand as the people upon whom Allah's wrath was sent down drink, and let none drink at night from a vessel unless he moves/stirs the vessel, unless it is covered. Whoever drinks with both his hands while he is able to use a vessel, intending thereby humility, Allah the Exalted will write for him good deeds equal to the number of his fingers, and it is the vessel of Jesus son of Mary upon him be peace, when he threw down the cup and said: This is along with the world.",
