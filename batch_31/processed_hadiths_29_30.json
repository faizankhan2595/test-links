When he separated from Shu'ayb upon him be peace, he commanded his wife to ask her father to give her of his flocks such that they could live by it. So he gave her (the newborns) of what his flock gave birth to in that year of every color, and his flocks were black and beautiful. Musa upon him be peace went to his staff, so he placed it from its end and placed it at the edge of the trough, then he watered them (the flocks), and he stood at the nearest part of the trough and did not leave a single ewe except that he struck her with her side, so they became complete and became female (pregnant), and they all gave birth to every color except one or two ewes in which there was no defect, nor distortion, nor (disease called) 'auzun, nor (disease) tha'ul, nor (disease) kamshah that escapes the grasp.

    "english_translation": "Narrated by Murrah ibn Ka'b al-Bahzi in the presence of Mu'awiyah at Marj Saluqa: \"By Allah, I am not an orator, nor do I desire oratory, and if not for words I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, I would not have stood (to speak). When Mu'awiyah heard him mentioning the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, he ordered the people to sit down and be silent. So Murrah, may Allah be pleased with him, said: While we were in the presence of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ one day, Uthman ibn Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, passed by walking. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'A trial will surely emerge from between his legs or from under his feet - this (Uthman) at that time and whoever follows him is upon guidance.' He said: I stood up as the youngest of the people in age until I took Uthman's shoulder, may Allah be pleased with him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ turned toward me and I said: Is this, O Messenger of Allah? He said: Yes, this, at that time and whoever follows him is upon guidance.' He said: Then Abdullah ibn Hawala al-Azdi stood from beneath the pulpit and said: And are you the companion of that day? He said: Yes. He said: By Allah, I was present at that gathering that day, and if I knew that there was one who would confirm me in the gathering, I would have been the first to speak about it. He said: Mu'awiyah was pleased, may Allah be pleased with him, and the people were pleased and joyful.\"",
