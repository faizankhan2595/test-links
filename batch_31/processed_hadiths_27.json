We prepared thareed (bread soaked in broth) with butter for him. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ came and entered the house. My mother placed a thin blanket for him, and I gathered it to make it more comfortable for him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sat on it, and we placed water before him. He said: 'Take with the name of Allah' and pointed with his three fingers to the top of it. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ finished, we said: 'O Messenger of Allah, invoke Allah for us.' He said: 'O Allah, forgive them, be merciful to them, and bless them in their provision.'",
