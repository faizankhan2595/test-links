He said: 'Yes.' He said: 'What is his name?' He said: 'al-Hubab.' He said: 'al-Hubab is a devil, but he is Abd al-Rahman.' So I said: 'Verily I have various types of wealth, I give charity from it and I free (slaves) from it and I carry it (give loans), but I spend it and it goes, then I return to it (save it again).' He said: 'Have you not known that an angel calls: O Allah! Make for the wealth of one who spends, a replacement, and make for the wealth of one who withholds, loss.' I said: 'O Messenger of Allah! With what shall I equip myself?' He said: 'With Glorify the name of your Lord the Most High, and Say: O disbelievers! I disbelieve in what you worship, and Say: He is Allah, the One.'",

When he embraced Islam, he became a guide for the Muslims. During the expedition of Dhat al-Salasil, I said: O Allah, help me find a righteous companion. Allah granted me Abu Bakr as a companion. He would make me sleep on his bed and give me garments from the garments of Fadak. When morning came, he would wear it, and its two edges would not meet until he patched it with a patch. The Hawazin said after the death of the Prophet ﷺ: We obey the owner of the patch. I said: O Abu Bakr, teach me something by which Allah will benefit me and do not make it lengthy lest I forget. He said: Worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, establish prayer, give charity if you have wealth, abandon your homeland for it is a degree of deeds, and do not command two men. When I said: Why? Is not leadership something sought after? And I mentioned it and its consequences. He said: People entered Islam willingly and unwillingly, they are Allah's shepherds and Allah's help and under Allah's protection. Whoever oppresses any of them, he violates Allah's protection. Talhah said: When I mentioned this hadith to Mujahid, he added: If you can ensure that Allah does not take you to account for His protection, do so",
