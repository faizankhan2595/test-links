I said: O Messenger of Allah, the horses have been left idle and weapons have been laid down, and they say the war has laid down its burden and there is no fighting. The Prophet ﷺ said: They lie. Now fighting has come. My community will continue to be superior over people. Allah will turn the hearts of a group for them and provide for them from that, until Allah's command comes while they are upon that. Then he said: I feel the breath of my Lord from this direction, while turning his back towards Yemen. And he said: It is revealed to me that I am being taken (death is approaching) and you will not remain long after me except a little, rather you will remain then remain until you say: When? And you will come in groups destroying each other. And before the Hour there will be intense death followed by years of earthquakes",

One said to the other: Do not call him a Prophet, for if he heard you, he would have four eyes (meaning he would be angry and his eyes would stand out). So they came to the Prophet ﷺ and asked him about nine matters. He said: Do not associate anything with Allah, do not commit fornication, do not steal, do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden except by right, do not walk with an innocent to a ruler to kill him, do not practice sorcery, do not consume usury, do not accuse a chaste woman, and do not flee on the day of battle. And for you Jews especially: do not transgress the Sabbath. They kissed his hands and feet and said: We testify that you are a Prophet. He said: What prevents you from following me? They said: David prayed that there would always be a prophet from his descendants, and we fear the Jews will kill us",

Then al-Aqra' ibn Habis al-Tamimi said: O Messenger of Allah, I have come to the salt land in the pre-Islamic era and it was in a land where there is no water, and whoever came to it could take from it, and it is like flowing water. So the Prophet ﷺ asked Abyadh ibn Hammal to reconsider the grant. Abyadh said: I will reconsider it on the condition that you make it charity. The Prophet ﷺ said: It is charity from you. And it is like flowing water, and whoever comes to it may take from it. And the Messenger of Allah ﷺ gave him land and water in al-Goufa, Jarf Murad, when he reconsidered it.
