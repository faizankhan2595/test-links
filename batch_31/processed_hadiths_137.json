They said to him: We see you with a bright and joyful face. He said: My Lord came to me tonight in the most beautiful form and said: O Muhammad, do you know what the High Assembly disputes about? I said: You, O Lord, know best. Then He placed His hand between my shoulders and I felt its coolness between my breasts and I knew what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. Then he asked them about what the High Assembly disputes about. I said: About the expiations. He said: What are they? I said: Walking on foot to the congregations, sitting in the mosques between the prayers, perfecting ablution in places of hardship. Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, said: Whoever does this shall live in goodness and die in goodness, shall be absolved from his sins as when his mother bore him, and from the degrees of elevation is feeding food, giving salutations, and reciting at night while people sleep: Say O Allah, I ask you for goodness and turning away from evil and love of the poor. Forgive me and have mercy on me and turn towards me. And when You will a trial for a people, take me away without being tested. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Learn them, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, they are truth.",

    "english_translation": "Narrated by Jundub ibn Makith al-Juhani: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ sent Ghalib ibn Abdullah al-Laithi in a military expedition, which I was part of. He ordered him to make a sudden raid on Banu al-Mulawwih at al-Kadid, who are from Banu Laith. We set out until we were at Qudayd where we encountered al-Harith ibn Barsaa al-Laithi and captured him. He said: I have only come wanting to accept Islam; I set out for the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. We said: If you are Muslim, the bonds of one day and night will not harm you, and if otherwise, we will bind you. So we bound him and left a young man from us, black, with him, telling him: If he struggles with you, cut off his head. Then we traveled until we reached al-Kadid at sunset. We laid in wait on the side of the valley, and my companions sent me as a scout. I went out and came to a hill overlooking the settlement so I could see them. When I reached it and climbed upon it, I lay flat on it. By Allah, I was watching when a man came out from them from his tent and said to his wife: By Allah, I see on this hill figures I did not see on the first day of this month. Look at our vessels - the dogs may not have taken anything from them. She looked and said: By Allah, I do not see anything missing from our vessels. He said: Hand me my bow and arrows. She handed him his bow and two arrows with it. He shot an arrow, and by Allah, it did not miss my side. I pulled it out and remained still. Then he shot the other and it hit my shoulder. I pulled it out and remained still. He said to his wife: By Allah, if this were a scout, he would have moved when two arrows have hit him. I swear by you, when morning comes, follow them, and do not chew them for me - the dogs might chew them! Then he went in. The livestock of camels and sheep came from them. When they milked and rested and fell asleep, we made a sudden raid on them and killed and took the sheep. The people cried out and their people came, but we had no power against them. We set out and descended until we passed by the son of al-Barsaa and took him and took our companion and the people caught up with us until we were watching them, and only the valley was between us, heading on its other side when Allah brought the valley from where He willed, filled on both sides of it. By Allah, the Exalted, we had not seen clouds before that or rain. So it came with what no one could prevent, and I saw them standing watching us, and we took it to al-Mushallal and broke it open to them, a people unable to pursue us in it. By Allah, I do not forget the saying of one of the Muslims who shouted at it: Abu al-Qasim refused to set in the carrying of the plant of the muddy one [poetry lines about camels]. Then we came with it to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.",

He said: I came to the Prophet ﷺ during a hardship that had befallen the people. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Distribute them among you. A man would take the hand of two men. The people avoided me because of my great size and height. So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ took my hand to his house and milked a sheep for me and I drank its milk, then he milked another for me and I drank its milk, then he milked another for me and I drank its milk until he had milked seven for me. Then I went away. When it was the next day, I became Muslim. Then I came and he milked one sheep for me and I became satisfied and quenched. I said: By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, I was never satisfied or quenched before today. He said: The believer drinks in one intestine while the disbeliever drinks in seven intestines.",
