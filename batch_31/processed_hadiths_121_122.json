Are you laughing at the Book of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic?

And: 'My aunt took me to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and she said: O Messenger of Allah, my nephew is ill. So he wiped my head and supplicated blessings for me, and he performed ablution, so I drank from his ablution water.' And: 'When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ returned from Tabuk, the people came out to meet him at the Hill of Farewell. Al-Saib said: I went out with the people while I was a boy, and we met him.'",
