So send down tranquility upon us and establish our feet if we meet them.\" The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: \"May your Lord have mercy upon you.\" Umar ibn al-Khattab said: \"By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, it is ordained [success].\" He was killed on the day of Khaybar as a martyr.",

They will abandon it while it is in its best state and most populous condition. The Dajjal will come and find at each gate of its gates an angel unsheathing his sword, so he will not enter it.' Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ descended while taking my hand, entered the mosque, and there was a man praying. He said: 'Who is this?' I praised him, so he said: 'Be silent, do not let him hear you, for you will destroy him.' Then he came to the door of one of his wives' chambers and withdrew his hand from mine, then said: 'The best of your religion is its easiest, the best of your religion is its easiest.'",
