He said: Then I have no need for it. Then he said: O Dhu al-Jawshan, will you not embrace Islam so that you are among the first of this affair? I said: No. He said: Why? I said: Because I see your people are attached to you. He said: How did the news of their deaths reach you? I said: It has reached me. I said: If you would guide me. I said: If you overcome the Kaaba and dwell in it. He said: Perhaps if you live you will see that. He said: O Bilal, take the man's saddlebag and provide him from the Ajwa dates. When I turned back, he said: Indeed he is the best horseman of Banu Amir. He said: By Allah, I was with my family at al-Ud when a rider came. I said: From where? He said: From Makkah. I said: What did the people do? He said: By Allah, Muhammad ﷺ has overcome it and dwelt in it. I said: My mother has ruined me had I embraced Islam at that time. Then I asked him for al-Hira so he would give it to me. He said: By Allah, I will not drink oil from a cup nor will a mule be broken in my land.",

Then he called his people to Islam but they refused to answer him until they could avenge their blood feud. So they came to a group of Banu Uqail and injured one of them. Then Banu Uqail pursued them fighting them while among them was a man called Rabia ibn al-Mushfiq reciting poetry: I swear I will not thrust except at a horseman when the people are wearing helmets. A man from the tribe said: Are you safe for the rest of the day? He said: Then al-Muharrish ibn Abdullah resisted and we thrust twice. The Uqaili man thrust at his arm and severed it. He embraced his horse then said: O clan of Ruas. Rabia said: What is Ruas? A mountain or people? They came to Umar and the Prophet ﷺ with his hand shackled to his neck when he had done wrong. He came to Madina and heard youths saying when he came to Madina: If he comes to me with his hand shackled to his neck I will strike what is above the shackle. He came to the Prophet ﷺ from before him and said: O Messenger of Allah, be pleased with me. He turned away from him. He came to him from behind and said the same, then came to him from his right and left, then came to him from before and said: O Messenger of Allah, be pleased with me, may Allah be pleased with you, by Allah verily the Lord is pleased and He is pleased. He said: And I am pleased with you.",
