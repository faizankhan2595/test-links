    "english_translation": "Narrated: Malik ibn Abdullah saw a companion walking and leading his horse at Dhat al-Jawn. He called to him: O brother, why don't you ride? He replied: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: Whoever has dusty feet in the way of Allah, Mighty and Exalted, Paradise will be obligatory for him. So I want that to be obligatory for me from my Lord, and let my beast be returned to me. Let it enrich me from my companion's beast. Malik said: Allah is Greatest! Then he dismounted and the people dismounted with him, all together, and they led their beasts. Ibn Ayyash said: The one who was walking was Iyad ibn Ghunam.",

So he went out and said: O assembly of Quraysh, is there anyone among you other than yourselves? They replied: No, except the children of our sisters. The Prophet ﷺ said: The child of the sister of the people is from them. Then he said: O assembly of Quraysh, know that the closest of people to me are the God-fearing. Take care that people do not come to you on the Day of Resurrection with deeds while you come carrying this world that you are bearing. So I will turn my face away from you. Then he recited: Indeed, the closest of the people to Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Guardian of the believers (Al-Imran 68).",
