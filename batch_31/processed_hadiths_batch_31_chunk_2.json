    "english_translation": "Narrated by Dhu al-Jawshan al-Dibabi: I came to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ after (the battle of) Badr was completed with a young female horse of mine called al-Qarhaa for him to use. He said: I have no need for it, and if I wanted I could repay you with the best of the armors from Badr, and make what I would have repaid you today with something else. He said: Then I have no need for it. Then he said: O Dhu al-Jawshan, will you not embrace Islam so that you are among the first of this affair? I said: No. He said: Why? I said: Because I see your people are attached to you. He said: How did the news of their deaths reach you? I said: It has reached me. I said: If you would guide me. I said: If you overcome the Kaaba and dwell in it. He said: Perhaps if you live you will see that. He said: O Bilal, take the man's saddlebag and provide him from the Ajwa dates. When I turned back, he said: Indeed he is the best horseman of Banu Amir. He said: By Allah, I was with my family at al-Ud when a rider came. I said: From where? He said: From Makkah. I said: What did the people do? He said: By Allah, Muhammad ﷺ has overcome it and dwelt in it. I said: My mother has ruined me had I embraced Islam at that time. Then I asked him for al-Hira so he would give it to me. He said: By Allah, I will not drink oil from a cup nor will a mule be broken in my land.",
