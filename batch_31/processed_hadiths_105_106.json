    "english_translation": "Narrated by al-Harith ibn al-Khazraj al-Ansari, from his father, that he heard the Prophet ﷺ asking the Angel of Death at the head of a man of the Ansar saying: O Angel of Death, be gentle with my companion for he is a believer. The Angel of Death said: O Muhammad, be at ease and let your eye be cooled, for I am gentle with every believer. Know O Muhammad that when I take the soul of the son of Adam and his family member cries out, I stand at the side of the house with his soul and say: What is this crying? By Allah, we have not wronged him, we did not precede his appointed time, nor hastened his decree. We have no sin in taking his soul. If you are pleased with what Allah does and you are patient, you will be rewarded. If you are impatient and displeased, you will sin and be burdened. You have no complaint against us. Rather, for us with you is a desire for return after return. So beware, beware! And salvation, salvation! There is no family, whether of hair or mud or plain or mountain or sea, but I examine them every day and night five times, until I know their small and great by their own faces. By Allah, if I wished to take the soul of a mosquito, I could not unless Allah the Mighty and Majestic commands its taking",
