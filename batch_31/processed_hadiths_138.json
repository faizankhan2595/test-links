    "english_translation": "Narrated by Al-Faltan ibn Asim: We were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ when revelation came to him. When revelation came to him, his gaze would remain fixed, he would open his eyes, and he would concentrate his hearing and sight to what came to him from Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. We would recognize that from him. He said to the scribe: Write \"Those who sit are not equal among the believers, except those with injury\" until he reached \"And Allah has promised them all goodness\". A blind man stood up and said: What is our fault, O Messenger of Allah? Then Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, revealed to the Prophet ﷺ. We said that revelation was coming to the Prophet ﷺ, so the blind man became afraid that something concerning him might be revealed. He said: I seek refuge in the anger of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He remained standing and said: I seek refuge in the anger of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. The Prophet ﷺ said to the scribe: Write \"except those with injury\".",
