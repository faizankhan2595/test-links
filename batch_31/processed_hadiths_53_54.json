When they intended to depart, they said: We have memorized everything we heard from the Prophet ﷺ. Then they asked him about Nabidh (fermented drink). They said: O Messenger of Allah, we are in a land of filthy climate, and nothing cures us except drink. He said: What is your drink? They said: Nabidh. He said: In what do you drink it? They said: In al-Naqir (a hollowed tree trunk). He said: Do not drink from al-Naqir. Then they went out, and they said: By Allah, our people will not accept this from us. So they returned and asked him again. He said to them similarly. Then they repeated, and he said to them: Do not drink from al-Naqir, for a man among you might strike his cousin a blow from which he will remain lame until the Day of Resurrection. Then they laughed. He said: Why do you laugh? They said: O Messenger of Allah, by the One who sent you with truth, we drank from a Naqir of ours, and one of us struck another a blow from which he remained lame until the Day of Resurrection.",
