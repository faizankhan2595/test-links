When he finished his prayer and turned away, behold he (saw) two men in the back of the people who had not prayed with him. So he said: bring them to me. They came to him trembling in their bodies. He said: What prevented you from praying with us? They said: O Messenger of Allah, we had already prayed in our tents. He said: Do not do that - when you have prayed in your tents, then come to a mosque where people gather and pray with them, for indeed it is a supererogatory prayer for you.",

So we asked him about the fear which Allah the Most High cast into the hearts of the disbelievers on the day of Hunain. How was it? He said: He would take for us a stone and throw it at a brass vessel (tast) and it would ring/resound. He said: So we would find in our chests something like this. And he said when the Muslims retreated on the day of Hunain and the disbelievers followed them, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ took a handful of earth, then turned with it towards the disbelievers, and threw it at their faces, and said: Return, shame be upon the faces. So there was not one of us who met his brother except he was complaining to him of the speck in his eye, and wiping his eye.",
