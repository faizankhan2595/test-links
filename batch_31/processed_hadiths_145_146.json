Some people hastily left saying: 'Has the prayer been shortened? Has the prayer been shortened?' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ stood and Dhu al-Yadayn caught up with him and said: 'O Messenger of Allah, has the prayer been shortened or did you forget?' He said: 'The prayer has not been shortened nor did I forget.' Then he turned to Abu Bakr and Umar and said: 'What does Dhu al-Yadayn say?' They said: 'He is right, O Messenger of Allah.' So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ returned and the people returned, and he prayed two more rak'ahs, then performed the taslim, then performed two prostrations of forgetfulness.",

I went with him and Jubair asked him about the truce. He said: I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ saying: 'You will make a secure truce with the Romans, then you and they fight against an enemy together, you will be victorious and you will gain spoils and will be safe, then you will return until you descend in a meadow of two hills. Then a man from the Christians will raise the cross and will say: The cross has conquered. Then a man from the Muslims will become angry and rise up to him and strike it. At that time the Romans will break the truce and gather for battle.'",

A force from you will camp in their city and you will fight together against an enemy behind you and behind them. You will kill that enemy and Allah will open for you. You will return with reward and spoils and descend in a meadow of two hills. Then one of you will say: Allah the Mighty and Majestic has conquered. And one of them will say: The cross has conquered. They will dispute about it for a while. Then the Muslims will become angry and from them the cross is not far. A man from the Muslims will rise to their cross and strike it. They will strike his neck and kill him. Then that band of Muslims will rise to their weapons and the Romans will rise to their weapons and they will kill that band of Muslims and they will be martyred. They will come to their king and say: We have sufficed you from the heat of war and their might. So what do you await? He will gather for you the size of a pregnancy of a woman and then comes to you under eighty banners, under each banner twelve thousand.'",

A force from you will camp in their city then you will fight together against an enemy from behind them. They will return safe and gaining spoils until you descend in a meadow of two hills. Then one of them will say: The cross has conquered, and one of you will say: Allah the Mighty and Majestic has conquered. They will exchange these words and the cross is not far from them. Then one of you will rise to the cross and break it. They will rise to him and kill him. Then you will rise to your weapons and they will rise to their weapons. Allah will defeat that band of Muslims so none of them escapes except those carrying the mark. They will return to their king and say: We have sufficed you from the war of the Arabs and their might. What do you await? They will gather for you the size of a nine-month pregnancy and come to you under eighty banners, under each banner twelve thousand. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: That is the great slaughter.'",

Someone said: O Messenger of Allah, the people have fallen behind you. He sat down until the people caught up with him. The Prophet ﷺ or one of them said: Would you like a nap? This was acceptable to them. They said: Yes, may Allah make us your ransom. He descended and they descended. The Prophet ﷺ said: Who will guard us tonight? Dhu Mikhmar said: I will, O Messenger of Allah, may Allah make me your ransom. He gave me his she-camel and said: Here, do not be lazy. I took the she-camel's halter and moved away a little. I was guarding while they grazed. Sleep overtook me and I did not wake until I felt the sun's heat on my face. I looked right and left and found the two camels nearby. I went to them and took their halters and came to the people who were sleeping. I woke the nearest one and asked: Did you pray? He said: No. Some of them woke the others until the Prophet ﷺ woke. He said: Bilal, is there water in the waterskin? He said: Yes, may Allah make me your ransom. He performed ablution without wiping off the dust, stood and prayed two rak'ahs without haste, then ordered Bilal to call the Adhan. He called the Iqamah and prayed with them without haste. Someone asked: O Messenger of Allah, have we neglected? He said: Allah took our souls and then returned them to us, and we have prayed.",
