A man sneezed, so I said \"May Allah have mercy upon you.\" The people stared at me, so I said \"May my mother be bereaved of me! What is the matter with you, why are you looking at me during prayer?\" They struck their thighs with their hands to signal me to be silent. When I saw them signaling me to be silent, I became silent. When the Messenger of Allah ﷺ finished the prayer, he called me. I have not seen a better teacher than him. He did not hit me, nor did he reproach me, nor did he insult me. He said: \"This prayer is not a place for any worldly speech. It consists only of glorification of Allah, praises to Allah, and recitation of the Qur'an.\" And Mu'awiyah ibn al-Hakam (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: I said: \"O Messenger of Allah, we are people recently come out of ignorance and Allah the Mighty and Majestic has brought Islam. Some of us draw. He said: A prophet among the prophets drew, so whoever conforms with his drawing, that is permissible. I said: O Messenger of Allah, some of us observe omens. He said: That is something you find in your hearts. Let it not turn you away. I said: O Messenger of Allah, some of us visit soothsayers. He said: Do not visit them. And Mu'awiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated: I said: O Messenger of Allah, I had a slave girl who tended sheep for me near Uhud and al-Jawwaniyyah, and I looked at her one day and found that a wolf had taken one of her sheep, and I am one of the children of Adam and become angry as they become angry. So I struck her a blow. The Prophet ﷺ was displeased with this. I said: O Messenger of Allah, should I free her? He said: Call her to me. He said to her: Where is Allah? She said: Allah is in the heaven. He said: Who am I? She said: You are the Messenger of Allah. He said: Free her, for she is a believer.",
