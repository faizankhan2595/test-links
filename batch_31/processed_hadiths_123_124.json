He said: Will you not give me something to learn, to carry, which will benefit me and not harm you? The people said: Sit. So the Prophet ﷺ said: Leave him, for indeed the man only asked to learn. Then they made way for him until he sat. He said: What was the first sign of your prophethood? He said: Allah the Mighty and Majestic took a covenant from me as He took a covenant from the prophets, and Allah said: And when We took a covenant from the prophets and from you and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary (Quran 33:7), and the mother of the Prophet ﷺ saw in her dream that a lamp came forth from between her legs illuminating the palaces of al-Sham. Then he said Hah and brought his ear closer to him as if there was something in his hearing. So the Prophet ﷺ said: And beyond that.",
