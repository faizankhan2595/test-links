He said: I swear by Allah, I heard Khuzayma ibn Thabit, the one whom Allah's Messenger made his testimony equal to the testimony of two men, that a man came to the Prophet ﷺ and said: O Messenger of Allah, I come to my wife from the back. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: Yes, he said it twice or three times. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ understood what he meant and said: As for in her back in her front, then yes.

(3) 'We were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ on a journey, and we came to a shallow well. Six or seven people descended, I being the sixth or seventh, to draw water. They lowered a bucket to me while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was at the edge of the well. We filled it half or about two-thirds. I raised it to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and I could hardly find anything to put in my mouth. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ dipped his hands in it and said what Allah willed him to say. The bucket was returned to us with water in it. I saw the last of us come out with his garment for fear of drowning, and the well overflowed.'",

They complained to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ about the exhaustion of their animals. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ began to breathe upon their backs and say: 'O Allah, carry them in Your way, for indeed You carry the strong and the weak, the fresh and the withered, on land and on sea.' We did not reach Medina until they (the animals) were pulling on their reins with vigor. Fadalah said: This was the supplication of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ for the strong and the weak, so what about the fresh and the withered? When we reached Syria, we went on the expedition to Cyprus by sea, and I recognized the supplication of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ (as applying to sea travel as well).",
