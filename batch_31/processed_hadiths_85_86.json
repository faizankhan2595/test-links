He placed them in a position and said: If you see us being taken away by the birds (i.e., defeated and killed), do not leave your position until I send to you. And if you see us having defeated the people and trampled them, do not leave your position until I send to you. Allah gave them victory, but the companions of Abdullah ibn Jubair said: The booty! The booty! Your companions have appeared victorious, what are you waiting for? Abdullah ibn Jubair said: Did you forget what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ commanded you?",

Then I returned to my father and he said: Did you see the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)? I said: Yes. He said: What did he say to you? I said: He said to me: Is this meat, O Jabir? He said: Perhaps the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) has a craving for meat. So he stood up to a domestic animal of his and slaughtered it, then skinned it, then ordered it to be roasted, then he ordered me to carry it to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and he was sitting in his gathering. He said to me: What is this, O Jabir? I said: I returned to my father and he asked me what did the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) say to you? I said: He said: Is this meat, O Jabir? So my father said: Perhaps the Messenger of Allah craved meat, so he stood up to a domestic animal of his and slaughtered it, then ordered it to be roasted, then ordered me to carry it to you, O Messenger of Allah.

He saw him unconscious, so he said: Has he died? They said: No, O Messenger of Allah. So the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) wept. When the people saw the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) weeping, they wept. He said: Do you not hear? Indeed Allah does not punish for the tears of the eye nor for the grief of the heart, but He punishes or shows mercy for this - and he pointed to his tongue.",

So Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: I will, O Messenger of Allah, describe him to me. He said: If you saw him you would be frightened. So I said: By the One who honored you, I have never been frightened of anything. So I went out until I met him in the mountains of Arafah before the sun set. Ibn Unays (may Allah be pleased with him) said: So I encountered fear from him, and I knew when I was frightened of him that he was the one the Prophet (peace be upon him) spoke of. He said: Who is the man? I said: One seeking a need, so is there lodging? He said: Yes, so follow me. So I went out following him, and I prayed Asr two brief rak'ahs, fearing that he would see me, then I followed him and struck him with the sword. Then I went out until I covered the mountain, and I stayed until the people left me alone, then I went out until I arrived in Medina to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and I informed him of the news. Muhammad ibn Ka'b (may Allah be pleased with him) said: So the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) gave me a staff and said: Carry this staff with you until you meet me with it on the Day of Resurrection - and the fewest people on that day will be those buried with staffs. Muhammad ibn Ka'b said: So when Abdullah ibn Unays (may Allah be pleased with him) died, he ordered it to be placed on his stomach, and he was shrouded over it and buried with it.",
