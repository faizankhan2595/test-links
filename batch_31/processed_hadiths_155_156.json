They opened a way for him until he looked at her. He said: 'This woman was not to fight.'

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ entered the mosque and said: 'Where is the Dosi youth?' We said: 'He is over there afflicted with fever at the side of the mosque.' The Messenger of Allah ﷺ came and spoke kindly to me. He said: 'If the Devil makes me forget something in my prayer, let the men exalt Allah (say Subhan Allah) and let the women clap.' Then he stood to pray, and behind him was a row of women and a row of men, or two rows of men and a row of women. When he finished the prayer, he said: 'Is there a man who closes a door and draws a curtain and says: I did such and such with my wife?' A slave girl stood up and said: 'By Allah, yes they say that, and by Allah, indeed they say it.' He said: 'Shall I tell you a parable of that? It is like the parable of a devil who met a she-devil on the road, and he lay with her while people were watching.' And he said: 'A woman does not touch a woman (in an inappropriate manner), and a man does not touch a man except the father with the son.' Then he said: 'Know that the perfume of men is fragrance without color, and the perfume of women is color without fragrance.' Abu Hurayrah had a measure of date-pits with which he would count his glorifications of Allah.",
