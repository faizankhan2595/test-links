I saw three amazing things from him: We descended in a land with many trees called al-Ashshaa'. He said: Go to those two trees and tell them: The Prophet ﷺ commands you to come together. I went to them and told them, and they came together. The Prophet ﷺ stood and fulfilled his need. Then he said: Tell them to separate, and they separated. Then a woman came with a child of hers. She said: O Prophet of Allah, this boy has epilepsy three times a month. He said: Bring him near. I brought him near, and he spat in his mouth and said: Go out, O enemy of Allah, I am the Messenger of Allah. Then he said to her: When you return, inform me what he does. When the Prophet ﷺ returned, she met him with two rams, butter (samn), and dried yogurt (aqit). The Prophet ﷺ said to me: Take one of the two rams. She said: O Messenger of Allah, we have not seen that from him. Then a camel came with tears flowing from its eyes. He said: Whose camel is this? They said: It belongs to the family of so-and-so. He sent to them and they came to him. He said: What is wrong with this camel that complains about you? They said: It was a well-watering camel for us and it grew old, so we wanted to slaughter it. The Prophet ﷺ said: Leave it with the camels, so they left it.",
