    "english_translation": "Narrated by Suu'ah ibn Najiyyah: I came to the Prophet ﷺ and he presented Islam to me, so I embraced it. He taught me verses from the Quran. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I performed deeds during the pre-Islamic period, do I have any reward for them? He said: What deeds did you perform? I said: Two female camels of mine were lost, so I went searching for them on my camel. I came upon a settlement and found an old man. I asked him: Have you seen two female camels? He said: What are their marks? I said: The brand of the Bani Darim. He said: We found them and they nurse their young and support two families of your people from Mudar. While the man was speaking with me, a woman from the other house called out: She has given birth! She has given birth! He asked: What did she give birth to? If it is a boy, he joins our people, but if it is a girl, bury her. She said: A girl. I said: What is this newborn? He said: My daughter. I said: I will buy her from you. He said: O brother of Tamim, do you tell me to sell my daughter? I have told you I am from the Arabs of Mudar. I said: I do not buy her body, but I buy her soul that you do not kill her. He said: With what will you buy her? I said: With these two female camels and their offspring. He said: Will you add your camel as well? I said: Yes, on the condition that you send a messenger with me. When I reach my family, I will return him to you. So he did. When I reached my family, I returned the camel. When night came, I reflected and said: This is an honor that no one of the Arabs has preceded me in. Islam appeared and I had saved three hundred and sixty girls, each one with two female camels and a camel. Do I have any reward for that? The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: This is a door of goodness and you have its reward, as Allah has blessed you with Islam. And he is the grandfather of al-Farazdaq ibn Ghalib.",

Abu Bakr said: And we do the same thing. So Hanzalah went and mentioned this to the Prophet ﷺ. The Prophet ﷺ said: O Hanzalah, if you were always as you are when with me, the angels would shake hands with you on your beds or on your roads, or something like this.
