When we intended to depart, he said: 'You have a right upon me and a favor, so I will narrate to you a hadith that I heard from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ.' We said: 'Go ahead, may Allah have mercy on you.' He said: 'We were with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, and with us was Mu'adh ibn Jabal, the tenth of ten people. We said: O Messenger of Allah, is there any people greater in reward than us, who believed in you and followed you? He said: What prevented you from doing so while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ is among you, and revelation comes to you from heaven? Rather, there will come a people after you who will receive a Book between two covers, and they will believe in it and act by it. Those are greater than you in reward. Those are greater than you in reward.'",
