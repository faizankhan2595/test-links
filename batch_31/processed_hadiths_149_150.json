O Lord, how many are the hungry, naked souls in this worldly life who will be satiated, comfortable on the Day of Resurrection. O Lord, how many honor themselves while being disgraced. O Lord, how many disgrace themselves while being honored. O Lord, how many wade through and squander from what Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, has granted His Messenger - what portion have they with Allah, the Mighty and Majestic? O Lord, indeed the work of Paradise is difficult through hardship, and indeed the work of Hell is easy through desire. O Lord, a desire of an hour has bequeathed its owner prolonged sorrow.",

Ka'b stayed and Bujayr went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. When the Prophet turned away from those around him, Bujayr presented Islam to him and he accepted it. This reached Ka'b, so Ka'b said: Will someone convey to Bujayr my message... (an elaborate poem follows praising Abu Bakr and the Messenger ﷺ). When this poetry reached the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ became angry, declared his blood forfeit, and said: Whoever meets Ka'b, let him kill him. Bujayr wrote to his brother mentioning that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ had declared his blood forfeit, and said: Salvation (is your only way), and that it is not that someone will kill you. Then he wrote to him that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ does not turn away anyone who comes to him witnessing that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, but accepts from them and remits what came before. So when you receive this letter of mine, embrace Islam and come. Ka'b embraced Islam and recited a poem - the poem in which he praised the Messenger of Allah ﷺ - and came until he tethered his camel at the door of the Masjid of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Then he entered the Masjid while the Messenger of Allah ﷺ was with his companions, arranged in circles before and behind one another. He came to them one moment and spoke to them, to those another moment and spoke to them, and to those another moment and spoke to them. Ka'b said: I tethered my camel at the door of the Masjid, then entered the Masjid and recognized the Messenger of Allah ﷺ by his appearance. I passed by them until I sat with him and embraced Islam, saying: I testify that there is no god but Allah and that you are the Messenger of Allah. Give me security, O Messenger of Allah. He said: Who are you? I said: I am Ka'b ibn Zuhayr. He said: You are the one who says (referring to the poetry). Then he turned to Abu Bakr and asked: How is it, O Abu Bakr? Abu Bakr recited the verses... Ka'b said: O Messenger of Allah, I did not say it that way. He said: How did you say it? Ka'b said: I said... He said: Approved, by Allah. And the Messenger ﷺ asked him to recite the entire poem 'Banat Su'ad' (The Maidens of Suad have departed).",

      "english_translation": "Narrated by Zayd ibn Abi Awfa: I entered upon the Messenger of Allah ﷺ in the Madinah Mosque, and he called out names - O son of so-and-so son of so-and-so - and sent for them until they gathered with him. He said: I am narrating to you a hadith, so preserve it and understand it and narrate it to those after you. Indeed, Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, chose from His creation a creation, then he recited this verse: \"Allah chooses messengers from the angels and from the people\" (Quran 22:75). A creation that He will enter into Paradise. And I am choosing from among you those I love to choose, and I am establishing brotherhood between you as Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, established brotherhood between the angels, peace be upon them. Stand O Abu Bakr. He stood and knelt before him. Then (the Prophet) said: Indeed, you have a favor with me that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, will repay you for it. And were I to take a friend, I would have taken you as a friend. And you are to me as my shirt is to my chest. Then he turned his shirt. Then he said: Come near, O Umar. He came near and he said: You have been severe in troubling and tiring us, O Father of Hafs. I supplicated Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, to strengthen the religion through you or through Abu Jahl. Allah did that through you. And you are more beloved to me than both, and you will be with me in Paradise, the third of three from this Ummah. Then they moved away, and he established brotherhood between him and Abu Bakr. Then he called Uthman ibn Affan, may Allah be pleased with him. Then he said: Come near, O Father of Amr. So he kept coming near until his knee touched the knee of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He looked at the sky, then said: Glory be to Allah the Mighty. Then he looked at Uthman and his buttons were undone, so the Messenger of Allah ﷺ fastened them with his hand. Then he said: Gather your cloak on your chest, for you have a matter with the people of the heaven. You are from those who will come to the Pond while his neck veins are gushing blood. I will ask: Who did this to you? And you will say: So-and-so and so-and-so. This is the speech of Gabriel, peace be upon him, when he called from the heaven: Indeed, Uthman is trustworthy over every forsaken one. Then he called Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, may Allah be pleased with him, and said: Come near, O Trustworthy of Allah, and you were named in the heaven as trustworthy. Allah has given you authority over your wealth with justice. Indeed, I have a supplication for you that I have deferred for you. He said: Choose for me, O Messenger of Allah. He said: You have burdened me, O Abd al-Rahman, with a trust. May Allah increase your wealth. And he moved his hands. Then Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf moved away, and he established brotherhood between him and Uthman. Then he called Talhah and al-Zubayr and said: Come near me. They came near. He said: You are my helpers as the helpers of Jesus, the son of Mary, peace be upon them. Then he established brotherhood between them. Then he called Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas and Ammar ibn Yasir. He said: O Ammar, the transgressive group will kill you. Then he established brotherhood between them. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ called Uwaymir, the Father of al-Darda', and Salman al-Farsi, may Allah be pleased with them. He said: O Salman, you are from us, the people of the household. Allah has given you knowledge of the past and knowledge of the future, the first book and the last book. Then he said: Shall I not guide you, O Father of al-Darda'? He said: Yes, by my father and mother, O Messenger of Allah. He said: If they forsake you, they forsake you. And if you leave them, they will not leave you. And if you flee from them, they will overtake you. So lend them your honor for the day of your poverty, and know that the recompense is before you. Then he established brotherhood between them. Then he looked at the faces of his companions and said: Receive good tidings and be glad, for you are the first to come to the Pond and you are in the highest chambers. Then he looked at Abdullah ibn Umar and said: Praise be to Allah, who guides from straying and causes straying for whom He loves. Then Ali ibn Abi Talib stood and said: O Messenger of Allah, my soul has departed and my back has broken when I saw you did with your companions what you did except for me. If it is from anger with me, then forgiveness and honor are for you. He said: By the One who sent me with truth, I chose you only for myself. You are to me as Aaron was to Moses, except there is no prophet after me. So you are my brother and my inheritor. He said: O Messenger of Allah, what do I inherit from you? He said: What the Prophets before you inherited. He said: The Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet. You are my brother and my companion. Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ recited the verse: \"Brothers on thrones facing one another\" (Quran 15:47). Friends in Allah looking at one another.",
