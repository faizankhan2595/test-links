I came to them while they were eating food. They welcomed me and honored me, saying 'Come and eat.' I said: 'I have come to prohibit you from this food, and I am the messenger of the Messenger of Allah to you to make you believe.' They rejected me and scolded me. I left hungry and thirsty with severe hardship upon me. I slept and was given a drink of milk in my sleep by which I was satisfied and quenched, and my belly became great. The people said: 'A man from your best people and nobles has come to you and you scolded him. Go to him and feed him from food and drink as he wishes.' They came to me with food, and I said: 'I have no need for your food and drink, for Allah the Mighty and Majestic has fed me and given me to drink.' Look at the state I am in.' So they believed in me and in what I brought from the Messenger of Allah.",

Allah the Mighty and Majestic promised me that He will enter seventy thousand from my community into Paradise without reckoning. Yazid ibn al-Akhnaf said: By Allah, those in your community are like the red flies among flies. The Messenger of Allah said: Indeed Allah promised me seventy thousand with each thousand seventy thousand, and added me three handfuls. He asked: What about the extent of your Pond? He said: It is whiter than milk, sweeter than honey, and more fragrant than musk. Whoever drinks from it will never thirst after, and his face will never blacken."

    "english_translation": "Narrated by Abu Umama al-Bahili: The Messenger of Allah ﷺ delivered a sermon one day. Most of his sermon consisted of narrating to us about the Dajjal and warning us against him. He said: 'O people, there has never been a greater trial on earth than the trial of the Dajjal. Allah did not send any prophet except that he warned his community, and I am the last of the prophets and you are the last of the communities, and he will certainly emerge among you. If he emerges while I am among you, I am the defender of every Muslim, and if he emerges after me, each person is the defender of themselves, and Allah is my successor over every Muslim. He will emerge from a barren land between the Sham and Iraq, corrupting right and left. O servants of Allah, be steadfast. He will begin saying I am a prophet, and there is no prophet after me, then he will say I am your Lord, and you will not see your Lord until you die. He is one-eyed, and your Lord is not one-eyed. It is written between his eyes Kafer (disbeliever), which every illiterate person will read. Whoever meets him should spit in his face. Among his trials is that he has with him a garden and fire - his fire is a garden and his garden is fire. Whoever is tested with his fire should recite the end of Surah al-Kahf and seek refuge with Allah the Mighty and Majestic, it will be upon him as coolness and peace as the fire was upon Ibrahim ﷺ. Among his trials is that with him are devils assuming the shapes of people, so he comes to the Bedouin and says: If I resurrect your father and mother, will you testify that I am your Lord? He says yes, so devils appear to him in the shapes of his parents and say: O son, follow him for he is your Lord. Among his trials is that he has power over a soul, kills it, then brings it back to life, and no one else will experience this. He says: Look at this servant of mine, I am resurrecting him now and he claims he has a Lord other than me. He resurrects him, and the soul says: Who is your Lord? He says: My Lord is Allah and you are the Dajjal, the enemy of Allah. Among his trials is that he says to the Bedouin: If I resurrect your camels, will you testify that I am your Lord? He says yes, so his devils appear to him in the shape of his camels. Among his trials is that he commands the sky to rain and it rains, and he commands the earth to produce vegetation and it produces. He passes by a tribe from the Arabs who reject him - not a single grazing animal remains for them except it perishes. And he passes by a tribe who believe in him - he commands the sky to rain and it rains, and he commands the earth to produce and it produces. Their cattle return to them that day the greatest, fattest and most abundant they have ever been. His days are forty days - one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of his days like your days. A man will depart from the gate of Madinah and will not reach the other gate until the sun sets.' They said: O Messenger of Allah, how do we pray in those short days? He said: 'You will estimate time as you estimate it in these long days, then pray. No place on earth will remain except that he treads upon it and overpowers it except Makkah and Madinah. He will not approach them from any pass except that he meets an angel with an unsheathed sword until he descends at al-Arikh al-Ahmar at the junction of the marshes at the confluence of the floods. The city will tremble with its people three trembles - no hypocrite or hypocritical woman will remain except they go out to him. Madinah will expel its filth as the bellows expels the filth of iron, and that day is called the Day of Deliverance. Then Um Sharik asked: O Messenger of Allah, where will the Muslims be then? He said: At Bayt al-Maqdis. He will come out to them until he besieges them, and the Imam of the Muslims that day will be a righteous man. Prayer will be established, and he will be told: Pray Fajr. When he takbirs and enters, Isa ibn Maryam ﷺ will descend. When the man sees him, he recognizes him and retreats, walking backwards. Isa ﷺ will advance and place his hand between his shoulders and say: Pray. He advances and Isa ﷺ prays behind him. Then he says: Open the gate. With the Dajjal that day are seventy thousand Jews, each with a coat of mail and a sword. When he sees Isa ﷺ, he will melt as lead melts in fire and salt melts in water, then he will flee. Isa ﷺ will say: I have a blow for you that I will not miss. He will overtake him at the Gate of Lud, in the east, and kill him. Nothing that Allah created will remain that a Jew can hide behind - neither tree nor stone - except that Allah makes it speak, saying: O Muslim servant of Allah, this is a Jew, so kill him, except for the gharqad tree for it is one of their trees, so it will not speak that day. Isa ibn Maryam ﷺ will be in my nation as a just ruler and fair Imam. He will break the cross, kill the pig, and warfare will be laid down. Charity will be raised so that nothing will be sought from a sheep or camel. Hatred and enmity will be removed. Venom will be taken from every venomous creature so that a child will put his hand into the mouth of a serpent and it will not harm him. A girl will play with a lion and it will not harm her. In camels it will be like their dog. The wolf will be with the sheep like its dog. The earth will be filled with Islam. Allah will strip the disbelievers of their dominion so there will be no kingdom except Islam. The earth will be like a silver basin producing its vegetation as it did in the days of Adam ﷺ. A group will gather around a grape cluster and it will satisfy them. A group will gather around a pomegranate and it will satisfy them. A bull will be worth so and so much wealth. A horse will be worth dirhams.'"
