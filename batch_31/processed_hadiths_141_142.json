The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said to the Hadramawti: 'Do you have evidence?' He said: 'No.' He said: 'Then the oath is his.' He said: 'O Prophet of Allah, indeed he is a wicked man and does not care what he swears upon. He does not abstain from anything.' So the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'There is nothing for you from him except that.' Then he went to swear for him. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: 'Whoever swears falsely on his property to consume it unjustly will meet Allah, the Mighty and the Majestic, while He turns away from him.'",

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ said: They lied. Now has come the time of fighting. My Ummah will remain dominant over the people.

One night while he was praying in the depth of the night, he was taken (by death) while in prostration. His daughter saw that her father had died and woke in fright calling for her mother asking where her father was. She said in his place of prayer. She called him but he did not answer. She came to him and found him prostrate. She moved him and he fell to his side, dead.",

I said: Pardon! Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, says: 'Upon you is [responsibility for] yourselves; those who have gone astray cannot harm you when you have been guided [Quran 5:105].' Abu Tha'labah rebuked me harshly until I wished my mother had not borne me, and I was deeply grieved by it and wanted to leave. But he took my hand and held me until the people dispersed, and none remained except me and him. Abu Tha'labah said to me: Did what I did to you grieve you? I said: Yes, by Allah. He said: We were in a discussion where we feared for our religion, then you came with this verse without bringing its interpretation. We know and command the good and forbid the evil, but a time will come when people will not be commanded to do good and will not be forbidden from doing evil.",
