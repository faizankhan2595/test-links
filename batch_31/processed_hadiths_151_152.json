He said: So the man remained until he met Ziyad. He said: So Ziyad refrained from him because of what reached him from the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. Until he met Ubaidullah ibn Ziyad. He said: So Ubaidullah ibn Ziyad sent to him and said: Are you the one who lies against Allah Mighty and Majestic and against His Messenger upon him be peace? He said: No, but if you wish I will inform you of the one who lies against Allah Mighty and Majestic and against His Messenger upon him be peace. He said: He brought to him the torturer. He said: When he came, he said: Bring me your torture. He said: So he came torturing him. He said: So Qais died may Allah be pleased with him before the evening without anything befalling him.",

So he became angry and raised his hand and struck my shoulder with it, then he said: Know that they are better than Banu Fizara, and better than Badr, and better than Banu al-Sharid and better than the people of your clan. Those ask forgiveness of Allah. When the Riddah (apostasy) occurred, not one of those whom the Messenger of Allah ﷺ favored remained except they apostatized, and I kept expecting the apostasy of my people. So I went to Umar may Allah be pleased with him and informed him, and he said: Do not fear! Have you not heard him say: Those ask forgiveness of Allah Mighty and Majestic?",

Is there any repentance for that? He said: Did you accept Islam? He said: As for me, I testify that there is no god except Allah alone with no partner for Him, and that you are the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. He said: Yes. Do the good deeds and abandon the evil deeds, so Allah Most High will make them for all the good deeds. He said: And my treacheries and wickedness? He said: Yes. He said: Allah is Most Great. So he kept saying Takbir (Allah is Most Great) until he disappeared. Abu al-Mughirah said: I heard al-Maysar ibn Ubayd, and he was knowledgeable in grammar and Arabic language, say: Al-hajah is the one who cuts off the wayfarers when they set out, and al-dajah is the one who cuts off them when they return.",

He said: 'O people of Quraysh, there is a phrase in it that if I told you, you would kill me.' They said: 'By al-Lat and al-Uzza, you are safe.' He said: 'Then no one will protect me from you.' We thought that it mentioned Muhammad (peace be upon him), so we concealed it. And: Ahmad ibn al-Furat narrated to us, Abd al-Razzaq narrated to us, from Ibn Jurayj, from Abdullah ibn Uthman ibn Khuthaym, from Muhammad ibn al-Aswad ibn Khalaf, from his father, who said: 'I saw the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) accepting people's pledge of allegiance on the Day of the Conquest at Qarn Masqalah or Masfalah.
