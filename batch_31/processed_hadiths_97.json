Will you kill our mother while there are people here who have disbelieving mothers and fathers? When Umayr feared that they would kill someone other than the killer, he went to the Prophet ﷺ and informed him. He said: Did you kill your sister? He said: Yes. He said: And why? He said: Because she was harming me regarding you. The Prophet ﷺ sent to her sons and asked them, and they named someone other than the killer.
