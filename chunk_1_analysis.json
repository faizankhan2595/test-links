    "english_translation": "Narrated through the chain: Uthman sent Sulayt ibn Sulayt and Abdur-Rahman ibn Attab ibn Usayd to Ibn Salam, saying: 'Go to Ibn Salam and disguise yourselves as if you are Bedouins from Atawiyya, then tell him: Unrest has befallen the people as you can see, so what do you command us?' They came to Ibn Salam and spoke to him in this manner. He said to one of them: 'You are so-and-so son of so-and-so,' and said to the other: 'You are so-and-so son of so-and-so. The Commander of the Believers sent you. Give him my greetings and inform him that he will be killed, so let him desist, for that will be stronger for his argument before Allah on the Day of Resurrection.' They came to him and informed him. Then Uthman said: 'I charge you that no one of you fights with me.' Marwan said: 'And I charge myself to fight,' so he fought and was struck upon his neck. He continued lying with his chin upon his chest until he died.",

They recited a recitation not like it, and prayed a prayer not like it, and fasted a fast not like it, and spoke a speech we cannot speak like it. When I considered the craftsmanship, I found they did not approach the companions of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. So when you hear the beautiful speech of a man, then say: \"Work, and Allah will see your deeds and His Messenger and the believers\" from Surah At-Tawbah, verse 105, and let not anyone deceive you.'",

Indeed, when they attacked Uthman and killed him, I said to the son of Abu Talib: Avoid this matter, for you will be dealt with, so spare yourself. But he disobeyed me, and I do not think he will succeed. By Allah, Mu'awiyyah ibn Abu Sufyan will surely prevail over you, because Allah said: \"Whoever is killed wrongfully, We have given authority to his heir\" from Surah Al-Isra, verse 33. By Allah, Quraysh will surely conduct themselves among you in the manner of Persia and Rome.' He said: We said: 'What do you command us, O Ibn Abbas, if we encounter that?' He said: 'Whoever among you takes what he knows is right will be saved, and whoever abandons it while you too abandon it, will be like one of these generations that perished.'",
