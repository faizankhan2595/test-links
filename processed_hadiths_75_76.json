The Messenger ﷺ was informed and sent for him, and Thabit complained about this. He said: I am a man who loves beauty and wants to lead my people. The Prophet ﷺ said: You are not among them, rather you will live in goodness, die in goodness, and Allah will enter you into Paradise. When Allah revealed 'O you who believe, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet' and 'O you who believe, raise not your voices in the presence of Allah's Messenger', Thabit was affected similarly because his voice was loud, and he feared his deeds would be nullified. The Prophet ﷺ said again: You are not among them, you will live in goodness and be killed as a martyr, and Allah will enter you into Paradise. When Abu Bakr called the Muslims to fight the apostates and the people of Yamama and Musaylimah the Liar, Thabit ibn Qays marched with them. When they met Musaylimah and Bani Hanifa, the Muslims were defeated three times. Thabit ibn Qays and Salim, the freed slave of Abu Hudhayfa, said: We did not fight this way with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ. They dug a pit for themselves, entered it, and fought until they were killed. A Muslim man saw Thabit ibn Qays in a dream and Thabit said: When I was killed yesterday, a Muslim man took a precious suit of armor from me, his dwelling is at the end of the camp, and at his dwelling is a horse tied up, and he covered the armor with a cooking pot and placed a saddle over the pot. Tell Khalid to send someone to get my armor, for when you come to the Caliph of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, inform him that I have such and such debt and such and such wealth, and such and such slave of mine is free, and beware lest you say this is a dream and waste it. So he went to Khalid and sent for the armor and found it as described. He came to Abu Bakr and informed him, so Abu Bakr fulfilled his will, and it is not known that anyone's will was fulfilled after his death except that of Thabit ibn Qays.",
