      "english_translation": "Narrated by Ibn Abbas: A man came out one day raising his gaze to the sky, lifting his hands above his head making supplication to his Lord. Ibn Abbas said to him: Supplicate your Lord with your right finger, and ask with your left palm. Lower your gaze and hold your hand, for you will not see Him and you will not attain Him. The man asked: Not even in the Hereafter? He replied: Not even in the Hereafter. The man asked: Then what is meant by the statement of Allah: Faces gleaming on that Day, gazing toward their Lord? Ibn Abbas responded: Do you not read the verse: No sight can grasp Him, but His sight grasps all? Then Ibn Abbas said: The allies of Allah will have their faces radiant on the Day of Judgment, which is the radiance and splendor. Then they will gaze toward their Lord waiting for His permission to enter Paradise after the completion of the reckoning. Then he mentioned the verse about gloomy faces, meaning dark and displeasing, fearing that punishment will be done to them. They await punishment after punishment. And similarly the verse gazing toward their Lord means the people of Paradise await reward after reward and honor after honor.",
