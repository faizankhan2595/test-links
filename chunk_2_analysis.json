    "english_translation": "Narrated from Ibn Taus from Ikramah ibn Khalid: Malik al-Ashtar entered upon Ali and said: The people have objected to some matters and said: 'How similar is tonight to yesterday! We objected to a matter and we find ourselves in the like of it.' He said: And with him were al-Hasan ibn Ali and Abdullah ibn Abbas. Then Ali said: 'O boy! Bring me the Jami'ah (collective statement of pact) and the sword.' Then al-Hasan and Ibn Abbas stood and said: 'O Commander of the Believers, we beseech you by Allah!' They continued speaking to him until he abandoned it and said to him: 'Go away.' He went out quickly and descended the steps of the house in fear. Then Ali said when he left: 'He separated us, so we separated him. So which of us was more destructive to his companion?'",

I said to a man from Banu Yashkur: 'Let us go to the Commander of the Believers until we ask him about his saying: Allah and His Messenger have spoken the truth.' He said: We went to him and said: 'O Commander of the Believers, we saw you whenever you witnessed a sight, or descended into a valley, or looked over a hill, you would say: Allah and His Messenger have spoken the truth. Did the Messenger of Allah ﷺ make a covenant with you regarding this?' He said and we pressed him, so when he saw that, he said: 'By Allah, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ did not make any covenant with me except something he made with all people. However, the people attacked Uthman and killed him. In this matter, others were in worse condition and worse action than me. Then I saw that I was the most deserving of this matter, so I overtook it. Allah knows if we were right or wrong.'",
