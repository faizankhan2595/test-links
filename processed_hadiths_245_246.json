    "english_translation": "Abu Khalid (the narrator) said: I asked Zaid ibn Ali about marriage between equals (kafaah), and he said: People are equals to each other: Arabs and non-Arabs, Quraysh and Hashimites. When they embrace Islam and believe, their religion is one. They have what we have and upon them is what is upon us. Their blood is one, their religion is one, and their obligations are one. There is no superiority for some over others in this. Allah the Mighty and Majestic said: Do not marry the polytheists until they believe. Thus He permitted all believers, both Arabs and non-Arabs, to marry the daughters of polytheists, both Arabs and non-Arabs, when they accept Islam. Zaid ibn Harithah, the freed slave of the Prophet, married Zaynab bint Jahsh, the Qurayshi woman. Bilal married Halah bint Awf, sister of Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf. Ruzyq, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah, married Amrah bint Bishr ibn Abi al-As ibn Umayyah. Abdullah ibn Razah, the freed slave of Muawiyah, married the daughter of Amr ibn Hurayth. Ammar ibn Yasir married the sister of Amr ibn Hurayth. Abu Mijdham ibn Abi Fakihah married a woman from Banu Zuhra. Zaid ibn Ali said: We asked the proud and arrogant people from the Arabs, saying: Tell us about the marriage of a non-Arab to an Arab woman, is it forbidden or permissible? Some said it is permissible, and some said it is forbidden. We said to them: If she bears him a child, will his lineage be established? They said: Yes. We said: Then it is permissible, for if it were forbidden, his lineage would not be established. If he divorces her before consummation, does she have half the dower? If he consummated the marriage, does she have the named dower or the dower of her like? If this non-Arab consummated the marriage, will that husband who divorced her three times become permissible for her? If he died and had wealth, would you give her inheritance from him? If her father or brother approved of this, is it valid or void? All of this is valid and it is a lawful marriage.",
